ANTH 10100,Introduction to Anthropology. 100 Units.,"Classically defined as the 'science of humankind' or the 'study of human diversity', anthropology examines how people organize themselves into groups and relate to the environment through their cultural beliefs and practices. Students will be introduced to the types of arguments, questions, and problems that have driven anthropological thinking, and to the discipline's unique focus on intensive fieldwork methodologies that span ethnography, archaeology, linguistics, and even biology. We will examine how anthropologists have historically studied topics like belief, kinship, ritual, politics, exchange, and material culture in the non-western world in order to unsettle western norms and assumptions. And we will explore how post-colonial critiques and indigenous perspectives have redefined the discipline in the twenty-first century. Students will learn how anthropologists are today contributing to solving complex global problems, from climate change to economic inequality, racism, violence, immigration, health disparities, political technologies, and the effects of social media. This course serves as a sampler for those curious about the field and it fulfills a basic requirement for those pursing the Anthropology major or minor. Offered at least once yearly by rotating faculty who will provide their unique take on the discipline.",,,Designed as a first course in Anthropology,Staff
ANTH 10107,Nature and Technology in the Capitalist Mode of Production. 100 Units.,"The crisis of nature and technology is at the heart of the 21st century mode of production as unprecedented planetary scale ecological destruction, climate change, and exhaustion of fossil fuels undercut the dynamics of capitalist accumulation. At the same time, novel techno-natural fixes are being designed to contain the crises immanent to the life process of capital. However, these movements are far from seamless; new tensions, contradictions, and horizons of struggles emerge making a critical inquiry of these concepts urgent to Anthropological thinking. In this course, the students will be introduced to foundational approaches to these problems. The first half of the course will intensively engage with dialectical materialist frameworks to understand the interrelationship between nature, technology, and consciousness in the capitalist mode of production. From this engagement, we will derive critical concepts that will be used to engage with the pertinent questions of planetary scale appropriation of human, non-human and more-than-human life in emergent anthropological theory and ethnographic literature. In doing so, our goal is to reflect on a series of questions: What is the place of nature and technology in the capitalist mode of production? How and if they embody limits to the workings of capital? How does anthropology allow us to develop new political and theoretical horizons that emerge in the wake of these developments?",,"CEGU 20107, HIPS 20107",,Ashima Mittal
ANTH 10200,Latin America in/at Chicago. 100 Units.,"This course explores the city of Chicago's Latin American and Caribbean roots by considering hemispheric connections, both in the city at large and at the University of Chicago. Students will analyze 1) the ways Latin(e/x) American actors have participated in and shaped Chicago's political economy, 2) how Latin(e/x)s on both sides of the US-Mexico border have impacted and been impacted by social thought at the University of Chicago, 3) the collection and display of Latin American material culture in several of the city's museums, and 4) Latin(e/x) American civil and human rights activism in the city. The course will move through the city chronologically as well as geographically over the long twentieth century.","Spring.

ANTH 10201,Immigrant Chicago. 100 Units.,"Since the early 1900's, thousands of Latin Americans have made Chicago their home. Today, approximately one-third of Chicagoans trace their roots to Latin America. These significant demographic flows raise critical questions: Why have Latin Americans moved to Chicago? How have they adapted to the city? How have they influenced it? This course will expose students to the latest social science research on contemporary immigration with a strong focus on Latinos in Chicago. We will explore its origins, adaptation patterns, and long-term effects on our city. To explore the Latino experience in Chicago, the course will focus on three communities: Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Venezuelans. These three groups migrated to Chicago during distinct periods, with Mexicans arriving in the early 1900s, Puerto Ricans in the 1940s, and Venezuelans in 2023. This temporal variation will enable us to investigate how the evolving social, economic, and political conditions in Chicago have influenced immigrants' experiences.","Spring.

ANTH 10202,Latinx Arts in Chicago. 100 Units.,"This course is an overview of the Latinx arts in Chicago. It explores artworks and artmaking as documents and critical fictions created in response to the social realities of urban Latinx populations in the U.S. and in Chicago in particular. It challenges students to think about (Latinx) art and the humanities under two modalities: as privileged arenas for understanding experience and exploring the values that guide a society, and as economic engines and instruments of political intervention. The course pursues these objectives though the study of the Latinx arts in Chicago, and through immersive engagements with local institutions where Latinx art operates (as historical object, as tool for social change, as fruit and seed of creative process, as instrument for economic development). Using the work of Latinx artists, curators, filmmakers, and other cultural brokers based in Chicago, the course studies artworks in the context of the social realities that gave rise to these works.","Spring.

ANTH 10536,How Societies Work (or Don't) 100 Units.,"How do societies work? Why do they so often seem to break down and fail? Should we even expect societies to ""work"" as cohesive entities, or should we assume that they are always rife with conflict, inequality and power struggles? In in this class, we will address these and other questions by taking a deep dive into different schools of social thought: materialism, which sees the production of goods and services as the force that shapes social organization; structural functionalism, which argues that society's various parts work together to strengthen social cohesion; social action theory, which argues values, worldviews and social institutions (e.g. religion and family) shape individual activities; symbolic interactionism, which focuses on micro-relationships; and, finally, post-modernism, which avoids any over-arching theory of society. Through these explorations, we will also address topics such as race, class, gender, technology, capitalism and modernity. Our readings will include works by Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, George Herbert Meade Michel Foucault, Pierre Bourdieu, Judith Butler and others.",Summer,,,
ANTH 12800,Formations of Indigeneity. 100 Units.,"Whose land are we on? What does it mean to be Indigenous, for generations past and in the twenty-first century? From debates over claims of Indigenous ancestry by political actors to the struggles of sacred lands protection against natural resource extraction, understanding the stakes of these concerns for Indigenous peoples and nations is more relevant than ever. This seminar-part of the sequence for majors in the Department of Race, Diaspora, and Indigeneity-introduces students to core texts and concepts in the field of Native American and Indigenous Studies (NAIS). Topics will include sovereignty and governance, settler colonialism, citizenship and nationhood, blood quantum and racialization, diasporas and urban indigeneity, and relationships to land and environment. Course activities may include engagement with Indigenous films, dialogues with visiting Indigenous scholars, and field trips to Chicago-area cultural institutions.",Winter,"CHST 12300, RDIN 12300, CRES 12800, HIST 17800",,Matthew Kruer
ANTH 20006,Embodiment and the Senses. 100 Units.,"This course approaches bodies as points of insight into governance, the varied experiences of being governed, and efforts to evade and reconfigure institutional expressions of authority. First, we will examine bodies as targets of governance, objects to be reformed, regulated, contained, disciplined, educated, incarcerated, treated, trained, and ""cared"" for. Next, we will consider how bodies accrue power as sites of resistance, refusal, and critique. Certain bodies in certain places elicit discomfort, unsettling familiar divisions such as of private and public space, of developed and backward, of religious and secular, of reason and madness, of citizenship and (often racialized) non-citizenship. Finally, we will ask how bodies and sensory practices figure in ethical projects of crafting exemplary kinds of subjectivity or collectivity. In this way, the course will introduce students to anthropological approaches to embodiment as well as related questions of bio-politics, gender and race, political subjectivity, care and self-making, post/colonialism, sensory politics and the aesthetic. Along the way, students will gain a new appreciation of the political potency of bodies and bodily practices near and far-from Lenin's preserved body to Trump's ""small"" hands, reproductive labor to sex work, dirty protest to women's marches, indigenous eco-rituals to queer intimacies.",,"RLST 26006, GNSE 24006",,Mareike Winchell
ANTH 20012,Gender Archaeology. 100 Units.,"How have archaeologists approached the study of gendered practices, and can their work contribute to theoretical and methodological discussions of gender across the social sciences and humanities? How can we use material objects and things to examine or explain gendered identities, especially in the deep past? In this course, students will engage with a range of research, from different disciplinary perspectives, to explore how gender is situated in archaeological theory and praxis and its political implications. Through multiple case studies, the course will interrogate how archaeologists study, analyze, and interpret material remains to examine gendered ideologies and material practices and their intersections with other social constructs: class, sex, race, ethnicity. Coverage is cross-cultural and aims to expose students to the diversity and variability of gendered and sexual experiences of different people across time and space. Topics include but are not limited to: embodiment and expression, gender roles, sexuality, parenthood and childhood, masculinity, biopolitics, and feminist theory.",,"SIGN 20147, ANTH 30012, CLAS 33024, GNSE 30147, GNSE 20147, CLCV 23024",,Alice Yao and Katie Kearns
ANTH 20013,Canine Kinship: Dogs in Human Societies. 100 Units.,"This course takes a four-field anthropological approach to exploring the multifaceted relationships between dogs and humans across time and space. We will read ethnographic accounts of the various ways dogs have lived and worked in human societies, some of which trouble the ideal of ""best friend"" with which many students may be most familiar; other readings will suggest that human societies would not be what they are today if not for myriad canine contributions. Through discussions of these texts and intermittent lectures, this seminar style class will explore how humans and dogs have worked, guarded, bonded, patrolled, communicated, stratified, lived, loved and died together. Students will produce original term papers or projects at the end of the course, as well as actively participate in and periodically co-lead weekly seminar discussions.",,,,E. Summmerson Carr
ANTH 20100,The Inca And Aztec States. 100 Units.,"This course is an intensive examination of the origins, structure, and meaning of two native states of the ancient Americas: the Inca and the Aztec. Lectures and discussions are framed around an examination of theories of state genesis, function, and transformation, with special reference to the economic, institutional, symbolic, and religious bases of indigenous state development. This course is broadly comparative in perspective and considers the structural significance of institutional features that are either common to or unique expressions of these two Native American states. Finally, we consider the causes and consequences of the Spanish conquest of the Americas, and the continuing impact of the European colonial order that was imposed on and to which the Native populations adapted with different degrees of success over the course of the 16th century.",,"LACS 20100, LACS 40305, ANTH 40100",,Alan Kolata
ANTH 20122,Mesopotamian Archaeology II: States to Empires. 100 Units.,"This course explores the archaeology of the states and empires of Mesopotamia during the early 2nd through mid-1st millennia BC. We begin with the Old Babylonian and Old Assyrian territorial states and end with the collapse of the Neo-Assyrian empire and the takeover of the Neo-Babylonian empire by the Persians in the mid 1st millennium BC, which marks the end of ""Mesopotamian"" culture. During these centuries, the region saw many political changes, developing from a network of expansive territorial states to massive hegemonic empires. But political developments also included retraction of states and two large-scale political collapses, in part driven by climate change. These millennia in Mesopotamia are also marked by internationalism in both archaeology and politics; trade, elite communication and conquest all affected the material culture of the sub-regions of the ancient Near East. Additional topics include the archaeological evidence (or lack of it) for ethnic groups known from textual sources, symbolism and hybridization in artworks, organic versus artificial settlements and landscapes, and the archaeological signatures of empire. The geographic focus encompasses northern and southern Mesopotamia (approximately the modern countries of Iraq and Syria); reference will also be made to southeast Anatolia (Türkiye) and the eastern Mediterranean.",Autumn,"NEAA 20122, ANTH 30122, NEAA 30122",NEAA 20001,"McMahon, Augusta"

This lecture course examines historical geographies of class and race relations in crucial arenas of urban life like employment, housing, public space and urgently during the contemporary era, climate change. A recurring theme we will explore is how Chicago's experience has shaped the field of urban studies across a range of thematic and conceptual domains.",Autumn,"CHST 20154, CEGU 20154, ENST 20154, RDIN 20154",,Mary Beth Pudup
ANTH 20200,Research Practicum for Undergraduates. 100 Units.,"This course is designed for third-year anthropology majors and minors who are planning summer research ahead of completing an honor's thesis in their fourth year. Students will learn best practices in research design for ethnographic, archaeological, and archival projects, receive guidance on developing their proposal and methodology, as well as applications for funding and IRB approval. The course will entail a mixture of in-person class time and in-field practicum assignments, with priority given to the latter. Students in allied fields or those planning other types of independent research may be considered depending on enrollment.",,,,
ANTH 20401,Anthropology of Healing. 100 Units.,"In our world marked by pandemics, stress, chronic illness, and cancers, healing is a primary concern, with people around the world experimenting with disparate techniques, from psychotherapy to psychedelics, to energy therapies and others. In this course we will rethink what it means to heal and to disease, reimagining healing as a practice that is deeply implicated in the ways in which we come to know, inhabit, and story the world. If we imagine our contemporary forms of life, entangled as they are, in legacies of colonial violence, capitalism, and ecological disaster, as ongoing sources of collective disease; how then do we re-entangle our ways of being, in anthropology and in the world, that encourage possibilities for healing? What would it mean to think our conceptual and sensorial practices as crucial to the ways in which we heal and disease? While the course design introduces students to anthropology and its methods, it pierces its confines and shifts the canon, or the story of anthropology, from its roots in colonializations or whiteness (and its myriad burdens) to the intimacies and desires of queer, sub-altern, black, and indigenous life-worlds. What are the ways in which disease is written into contemporary ways of being and how do we refuse to partake in it? How do we articulate stories that can not only bear lives on the margin but bear health? How can we story self and world differently? And how then, can we collectively live in more joyful and healing ways?",,"CHDV 30409, ANTH 30401, CHDV 20401, HLTH 20401",,Nida Paracha
ANTH 20511,The Archaeology of Egypt I. 100 Units.,"This course provides an overview of the archaeology of Egypt, focusing on data from the Paleolithic Period to the Second Intermediate Period, around 1,600 BCE. It introduces fundamental methods and approaches to the archaeological record, surveying significant sites, objects, art, and architecture to understand various aspects of culture, society, and history. While Egypt is well-known for its pyramids, temples and tombs, we will not only examine such constructions, but also explore how material culture can offer us insights on such themes as power and inequality, human-environment relations, urbanism, identity, cross-cultural interactions, collapse, and transformation. We will also consider the origins and legacies of Egyptology while engaging with diverse perspectives on the past, and how Egypt's rich cultural heritage continues to be valued, used, and contested.",Autumn,"ANTH 30511, NEAA 30511, NEAA 20511",,Anna-Latifa Mourad-Cizek

It introduces fundamental methods and approaches to the archaeological record, surveying significant sites, objects, art, and architecture to understand various aspects of culture, society, and history. We will consider how material culture can offer us insights on such themes as social organization, agency and identity, ritual practice, cross-cultural interactions, and climate change.

ANTH 20537,The Global Black Panther Party. 100 Units.,"In America, the Black Panther Party and its leaders, like Fred Hampton in Chicago, are famous for their revolutionary fight against white supremacy and their violent suppression by US government forces. But what does a Global Studies approach teach us about the Black Panthers? This seminar explores how the Black Panther Party's worldwide networks impacted global understandings of politics, race, and religion. Our readings examine a series of comparative case studies, including the Dalit Panther Party in India, the Mizrahi Black Panther Party in Israel, and the Polynesian Panthers in New Zealand. We analyze primary sources, such as the various Panther Parties' publications, their mainstream press coverage, and their pop cultural representations, like Ta-Nehisi Coates' Black Panther graphic novel and the film Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. In this course, students learn the global Black Panther Parties' roles in reshaping worldwide conceptions of race, caste, and religion through their encounters with the Nation of Islam, Hindu Nationalism, Zionism, and Indigenous rights. No prior knowledge or coursework is required.",Spring,"RLST 26674, GLST 26674, RDIN 26674",,Andrew Kunze
ANTH 20576,Social Theory for the Digital Age. 100 Units.,"Society rearranges itself, though we don't always know where it is heading. When the postmodern moment had arrived in the 1980s it perplexed social theorists, hence its characterization as simply a ""post""-stage of modernity. Digitization is one answer to the question of direction of change in the last decades. In this class, we take the ongoing transformations that we attribute to digital media as a starting point to ask what challenges they provide to social theory that may force us to reconsider some of our most basic concepts and premises. We will understand the term digital age broadly to refer to the rise of algorithms, sensors, (big) data, machine learning, and computational methods, all developments that swirl in and around the Artificial Intelligence scene and intersect with and replace purely human relations. The class gives particular attention to concepts such as action and interaction, embodiment, social situations, subjectivity and autonomy, as wells as society as communication.",Spring,"HIPS 20576, CHSS 30576, SOCI 20576, SOCI 30576, ANTH 30576",,K.

ANTH 20700,"Global Health, Environment, and Indigenous Futures. 100 Units.","The global coronavirus pandemic has made evident the significance of ecological (im)balances for the well-being of societies. The relationship between structural inequalities, changing environments and health, especially for historically and socio-economically marginalized communities, is now well established. At the same time, a growing body of literature links the material conditions of marginalized communities-for instance, spaces of dwelling and conditions of labor-to health status, globally. Based on a set of interdisciplinary literature arranged through anthropological theories, this course will critically engage with notions of health and well-being for indigenous communities, tracing injustices that stem histories of racial, caste- and ethnicity-based, and environmental exclusions. The readings are organized around one central question: What does it mean to be indigenous in a changing planet where social, political, and economic systems are marked by enduring legacies of systemic violence? This graduate and undergraduate level course will introduce contexts within which structural exclusions lead to ill-health and loss of well-being among indigenous communities across the globe. The aim is to develop critical thinking on the political economy and political ecologies of indigenous health as imbricated with issues of social, economic, and environmental justice.",,"CHDV 30750, RDIN 20700, CEGU 30700, CEGU 20700, ANTH 30700, RDIN 30700, SALC 26501, CHDV 20700, SALC 32704",,Sanghamitra Das

ANTH 21107,Anthropological Theory. 100 Units.,"Since its inception as an academically institutionalized discipline, anthropology has always addressed the relation between a self-consciously modernizing ""West"" and its various and changing ""others."" Yet it has not always done so with sufficient critical attention to its own concepts and categories - a fact that has led, since at least the 1980s, to considerable debate about the nature of the anthropological enterprise and its epistemological foundations. This course provides a brief critical introduction to the history of anthropological thought over the course of the discipline's ""long"" twentieth century, from the 1880s to the present. Although it centers on the North American and British traditions, we will review important strains of French and, to a lesser extent, German social theory in chronicling the emergence and transformation of ""modern"" anthropology as an empirically based, but theoretically informed practice of knowledge production about human sociality and culture.",,"CCCT 21107, RLST 27707",Preference for Anthropology majors,Stephan Palmie
ANTH 21108,Anthropological Archaeology. 100 Units.,"Archaeology is but ethnology in the past tense,"" wrote the prehistorian André Leroi-Gourhan in 1946. He expressed an idea shared by many, namely that archaeology and anthropology share a single set of aims: to investigate the workings of human society and culture, to examine particulars and illuminate universals. In this course, we will become acquainted with archaeology as a discipline of anthropology. Through readings, analysis of case studies, excursions, and practical exercises, we will learn the fundamentals of archaeological theory and method while exploring how archaeologists use them to examine anthropological questions. How do we study the development and structure of the social, political, and economic systems of the past? What can archaeology tell us about the formation of identities-self-same and other? How can the analysis of material remains shed light on the operations of culture, power, and agency? We will also look closely at ""anthropological archaeology"" as a historical object, from its early investments in ideas of primitive culture to contemporary issues of heritage, patrimony, and repatriation, archaeology's material, economic, and environmental impacts, and the potential of archaeologists to pursue restorative ways of engaging the past and the present.",,HIST 25509,,Daniel Hansen

ANTH 21211,Methods of Athropological Archaeology. 100 Units.,"How do you practice archaeology? This course aims to explore the many answers to that question, with an emphasis on practical experience. We will study how anthropological and archaeological theory are implemented through a global survey of case studies, exercises, and readings. Along with the main question, we'll also ask: What does archaeological theory do? How do people ""make"" theory from artifacts? What makes it ""anthropological""? Why should I care? How can I use it in my everyday life? Smuggled into those deceptively straightforward questions are critical questions of how archaeology is implicated in the project of modernity, seemingly stabilizing questions of place, time, and type; and how destabilizing these concepts can provide useful in our epistemologies and our practices both within the discipline of archaeology and outside of Haskell Hall. It is helpful if students have taken Anthropological Archaeology, but participation in Anthropological Archaeology is not required.",,,,Kelsey Rooney
ANTH 21303,Making the Natural World: Foundations of Human Ecology. 100 Units.,"What's natural about nature? Humans have ""made"" the natural world both materially, through millennia of direct action in and on the landscape, and conceptually, through the creation of various ideas about nature, ecosystem, organism, and ecology. In this course we will consider how the conceptual underpinnings of contemporary Western notions of nature, environment, balance, power and race are intertwined. We will trace this trajectory using the lens of the historical development of the field of ecology, then broaden our view to consider worldviews and ontologies about the environment from non-Western cultures. How then do these worldviews influence attitudes and policies towards land, environment, and its stewardship? Taking examples from current environmental topics (e.g. land rights, environmental justice, park access, conservation, extinction) we will evaluate the extent and character of human entanglement with the environment.

The main objects of our study will be the vast body of folktales and collateral folklore collected by anthropologists and folklorists in traditional societies. Despite the impact of literacy on modern minds this course argues for the persistence of ancient themes, plots, characters and motifs.. A further argument is made for the foundational role of storytelling in the creation of culture and construction of society …an argument, in short, that humans are, by nature, story-telling creatures whose sapience lies primarily in the capacity to create, be entertained by, and even live by, fictions The central place of storytelling is shown in the humanistic and social sciences: anthropology, economics, history, philosophy, politics, psychoanalysis.

ANTH 21403,Hidden in Plain Sight: Multi-Modal Inquiry into Technical and Speculative Worlds. 100 Units.,"How do people encounter phenomena that defy perception yet saturate their lives? What techniques are social scientists developing to investigate technology, the environment, and the virtual as they interrupt, exceed, or expand the human? Whether because of their monumentality (e.g., mass culture, infrastructure, disaster) or their latency (e.g., design, prognosis, information), these domains exhibit a ""suprasensible"" quality that can exceed bounded description. And yet, we are in constant contact with them. In response, scholars have devised ""multi-modal methods"" to broaden the social sciences' sensory, descriptive, and relational repertoires. This set of methods explores the analytic and ethical potential of non-linguistic description (e.g., photography, film, drawing, sound recording) and embodiment (e.g., performance, dance, role play). It also questions the possibilities and limits of reflexivity and collaboration, by revisiting the researcher-researched relationship. This course is a research practicum. We will dedicate half the week to discussing the objects, aims, and relevance of ""multi-modality"" to investigating technical and speculative worlds. In the second half, students will develop and workshop their original research projects incorporating multi-modal methods (whether course-specific or as part of a year-long thesis project).

ANTH 21405,"Neoliberalism, Self and Society. 100 Units.","Drawing on ethnography and cultural theory, this course examines the profound impact of neoliberal ideology on the everyday lives of individuals and communities across the globe. We will explore the ways neoliberalism, the idea that the mechanisms of free markets naturally precipitate economic growth and thus societal progress, shapes institutions, social norms, and, most importantly, individuals' understandings of themselves and others. Students will analyze the penetration of market logics into spheres of social life far beyond what used to be understood as ""the marketplace,"" such as education, politics and governance, healthcare, and the family. They will reflect on the effects of market logics on lived realities, both in material and ideological terms. As unfettered global markets produce growing inequality and insecurity, neoliberal tenets valorizing competition and productivity tell those who suffer from and witness such negative effects that they are unavoidable; the result of some people working harder and being better than others. This course will question neoliberalism's normative assumptions, drawing on ethnographic accounts of contemporary life in various regions and contexts across the globe. Students will end the course with an understanding of neoliberalism as an ideology and the ability to engage in discussions on neoliberalism that have emerged recently in the qualitative social sciences.",Winter,"ANTH 31405, MAPS 31405",,"Gross, Tori"
ANTH 21420,Ethnographic Methods. 100 Units.,"This course introduces students to the theory and practice of ethnographic methods. In the class, we will consider the ways ethnography works as both a mode of inquiry and a form of knowledge production. We will examine the kinds of questions anthropologists ask, as well as the relationship between research questions, methodological approaches, data analysis, and knowledge. We will examine the ways scholars marshal evidence to address their questions, and practically, how they arrive at that evidence. We will study different components of ethnographic fieldwork, such as participant observation, interviewing, photography, object analysis, archival work, digital methods, and qualitative surveys. In so doing, we will engage with the complexities surrounding ethnographic research, including how one negotiates access during fieldwork, the racialized and gendered subjectivities that inhere in fieldwork, the ethics of knowledge production, and the politics of representation. The class entails both critical engagement with scholarship, and practical exercises. The goal is to give students practical, theoretically grounded insights into fieldwork in order to help them understand how to develop and carry out a research project.",,,"Priority to Anthro Majors, Priority to Junior/Senior Standing",Kathryn Takabvirwa
ANTH 21424,Reading and Writing Ethnography. 100 Units.,"Ethnography -- as an activity, method, and analytical sensibility -- is an important part of defining and contesting what anthropology is and does. Critical perspectives on ethnographic research and writing have pointed out the authorization, exotification, and politics of mobility that undergird the 'where' in 'being there' as well as the designation of 'field' as the outside space for fieldwork. What's more, contemporary anthropologists are producing 'ethnography' that works against the term's very composition as ethnos (human classificatory grouping) and graphia (writing, inscription). Rather than theorize about what ethnography is or should be, we will consider and develop a practical understanding of ethnography by reading it and writing it. In this course, we will work with some contemporary ethnographies (and some ethnography adjacent works) that combine description and analysis in creative ways. Through regular exercises in observation and writing, we will explore together in class how ethnographic writing can develop conceptual and political arguments. A core objective of this course is to practice the reflective and intellectual work that goes into considering ethnographic research questions and composing the complicated texts that attempt to answer them. In simpler terms, this class is about writing and the deliberate and creative work that goes into it.",,,,Kamala Russell
ANTH 21426,More than Human Ethnography. 100 Units.,"In this course we explore the fields of more-than-human and 'multispecies' ethnography. We examine theoretical antecedents promoting the inclusion of non-human actors in ethnographic analysis and read examples of such work, including foundational texts on more-than-human engagements, exploitations, and dependencies by Deborah Bird Rose, Kim Tallbear, Eduardo Kohn, and Anna Tsing among others. We consider the role other species, 'actants' and assemblages played in early social science work and contemplate recent studies of ""becoming with"" animals, plants, fungi, bacteria-encountering complex symbioses, examining naturalcultural borders, and querying the role of decolonial thought and queer ecologies in the 'more-than' turn. Multispecies and posthumanist approaches encourage a decentering of traditional method; we couple ethnographic examples with literature by biologists, physicists, and philosophers. The is a discussion-based seminar with significant time devoted to logistical elements of 'more than' work-to querying how such studies are conducted in practice. The final paper takes the form of an exploratory essay based on observations collected during previous weeks.",Winter,"ANTH 33807, GNSE 21404, KNOW 32404, GNSE 31404, MAPS 31404",,"Wilhoit, Mary"

China's increasing presence concerns not only its economic power and massive investments in the Global South, but also its growing cultural and social influence-its so-called soft power in the world. The reading materials are drawn from anthropology, history, and social theory. By combining theoretical discussion with ethnographic studies on diaspora, Chinese capital, soft power, race, and racism in global Chinese contexts, the course will offer useful frameworks and perspectives for raising critical inquiries and tackling cutting-edge issues related to contemporary China. By the end of the course, the students will develop their own research subject on a topic that is related to global China; write a thorough literature review on their chosen topic; and present their research to the class.",,"MAPS 21545, MAPS 31545, ANTH 31545",,

This course will trace the conceptual genealogy of ecological governance in Western and Eastern political theory and environmental history as it explores the political ecologies of Israel and the Middle East. In so doing, the course embarks from the assertion that environmental justice and the struggle for justice overall are inseparable challenges.

How do individuals, groups, and neighborhoods grapple with death and decay? In this course, students will be offered lenses to answer these questions through engagement with interdisciplinary and multimodal texts drawn from sociology, anthropology, history, and urban studies. The goal of the course is to offer an introduction to how urban life and death are shaped by processes such as inequality, segregation, displacement, placemaking, urban governance, infrastructure and built environment, surveillance and policing, migration, and spatial practices of death and dying. The scope of the course will include Chicago-specific readings and field trips as well as national and global perspectives on urban social life and death.

ANTH 21901,"Race, Science and Empire. 100 Units.","The eighteenth century bore witness to the concomitant rise of scientific discovery and a modern sensibility of race hierarchy. Enlightenment pioneers-many with ties to the slave trade-who spearheaded the Age of Discovery also laid the groundwork for the ""scientific"" study of race. Drawing on the work of botanists, Linnaeus and Blumenbach developed taxonomic models for modern racial classifications. What had been the concern of a tiny group of physicians in the eighteenth expanded into a central focus of Euro-American scientific thought in the next. This shift into the new century marked a transition in inquiry from the origins of racial differences to their implications, accompanied by a shift from skin color to skull/body configurations as determinants of identity. Together, they gave rise to novel scientific practices such as phrenology, craniometry, anthropometry, and eugenics, enabling the quantification, with acute precision, of perceived racial differences. In this symbiosis of racial ideology and scientific method, the global expansion of the European empire found a powerful justification for the institution of slavery and the marginalization of the non-Europeans. By engaging with key texts from thinkers such as Kant, Voltaire, and Gobineau, alongside interdisciplinary critical scholarship on race science, students will examine how scientific racism was deeply intertwined with imperial ambitions and consider its lasting influence into the present day.",Winter,"GLST 21900, RDIN 21900, RDIN 31900, KNOW 31900, ANTH 31901",,Taimur Reza

Whether attributable to Holloway or not, the term 'Black death' circulates in scholarship, popular media, and political discourses arguably because it apprehends a commonsensical, albeit unfortunate, understanding of the relationship between death and Black people. This seminar-style course surveys death as an object of inquiry, metaphor, political occasion, and inspiration for aesthetic creation. The course is primarily Black Studies in its frameworks and subject matter- reading texts and other materials across disciplines, genres, and media. The course recognizes that the threads of race and death are inherently global and connected to European colonial imperial expansion, racism, capitalism, and modernity. Throughout the course we ask: What is the relationship between Black people or blackness and death? Is ""Black death"" unique? How do we take seriously ubiquitous legacies of violence while also accounting for socio-historical specificity? What are the attendant practices, creations, and modes of thinking and being associated with Black death? At the end of the course, students will have honed skills in close reading, critical thinking, and thoughtful discussion through the study of race and death.",Spring,CRES 22111,This is an advanced level course; students should have taken at least one course introductory critical race theories course prior to enrolling.,LaShaya Howie
ANTH 22134,Technology and Privacy in the Digital Age. 100 Units.,"In recent decades, increasingly invasive forms of digital surveillance have followed the internet into our phones, cars, homes, and public spaces. The uncertainties and anxieties thereby unleashed in everyday and national life include the widespread perception of privacy's impending ""death"". This course draws on history, philosophy, and anthropology to explore privacy as both an object of culture and as a cultural lens on unfolding changes in contemporary life. In the course, we will excavate the logics and historical projects that have privileged privacy as a keystone of liberal politics even while disavowing privacy's ongoing complicity in maintaining structures of oppression. In addition to exploring foundational questions related to privacy-What are privacy's origins as an object of the law? How can we reconcile the many competing definitions of privacy's purpose?-we will trace how privacy's increasing entanglement with technology, speculative capital, and counter-terror imperatives shifts both the forms in which privacy appears in everyday life and its political capacities. To make sense of ongoing, technology-based reconfigurations in citizen/state/corporate relations, we will look to the public events around which privacy manifests as a social ""problem"" (e.g., Facebook's secret 2014 emotional manipulation study) and analyze the adequacy of the legal and technical measures deployed on privacy's behalf.",,CMSC 10434,,
ANTH 22165,Politics of Technoscience in Africa. 100 Units.,"Euro-American discourse has often portrayed Africa as either a place without science and technology or as the home of deep and ancient wisdom. European imperialists used the alleged absence of science and technology as a justification for colonialism while pharmaceutical companies sought out African knowledge about healing plants. In addition to their practical applications, science and technology carry significant symbolic weight in discussions about Africa. In this class, we examine the politics of scientific and technical knowledge in Africa with a focus on colonialism and its aftermath. How have different people produced and used knowledge about the environment, medicine, and technology? What kinds of knowledge count as indigenous and who gets credit for innovation? How have independent African governments dealt with the imperial legacies of science?

ANTH 22305,Who deserves what? Analyzing inequalities in institutional decision-making. 100 Units.,"A key element of societal structuring is producing and reproducing ways to identify ourselves and categorize each other. Ways of differentiating often carry with them implicit or explicit moral assessments - is this difference good or bad, valuable or not? Government institutions and other systems of social organization make decisions and allocate resources based on markers of difference. Therefore, inequalities based on morally loaded categories become embedded in systems that decide who is deserving of earning a diagnosis, health care, a legal status or other resources. This course looks at the ways people become labeled (desirably or not), how these labels impact institutional or systemic decision-making, and how moral assessments are present in justifications of such decisions. Over the quarter we will introduce and apply the analytic of deservingness and investigate decision-making processes (e.g., diagnosis, legal claims, insurance coverage) in various geographic locations and settings with a focus on medical, legal, and bureaucratic institutions. We will explore themes of objectivity, evaluation, expert intervention, inequality, systemic violence and moral justification. Primary course questions include: How do institutions and governments make decisions? How are their decisions justified? What role do experts and expert knowledge play in decision-making? As an analytic tool, what does deservingness make visible about decision-making processes and their impacts?",,"HLTH 22305, HIPS 22305, CHDV 22305",,

Then, we expand on themes of social change, desire and identity, difference, kinship, and the significance of global, transnational and postcolonial connections in our understandings of gender and sexuality. The practical component of the course includes critical analysis of language and other signs that are used to enact gender and sexuality (e.g., in drag shows, communities you belong to personally, online communities, and current events). Throughout this course, we will emphasize the importance of ethnographic approaches to languages and communication-a hallmark of linguistic anthropology that requires a reflexive and critical attentiveness to how researchers co-participate in everyday social interactions with their interlocutors. Beyond the categories of gender and sexuality as studied in Western academic contexts, this course invites students to pay close attention to how non-normative forms of alterity are produced and circulated in the Global South under conditions of political and economic inequality.",Spring,"GNSE 20119, LING 22450",,Fadi Hakim

We will also consider social responses to ethnographic film in terms of 1) the contexts for producing and circulating these works, 2) the ethical and political concerns raised by cross-cultural representation and 3) the development of indigenous media and other practices in conversation with ethnographic film. Throughout the course, we will situate Visual Anthropology within the larger anthropological project for representing ""culture,"" addressing the status of ethnographic film in relation to other documentary practices including written ethnography, museum exhibitions, photography, documentary film, graphic illustrations (""manga"" ethnography), and new digital forms of engagement (Web 2.0, interactive gaming, augmented & virtual reality).

ANTH 22716,"The Mediterranean: Sea, Empires and People in Flux. 100 Units.","The aftermath of WWII is marked by a series of decolonial processes. Former colonies of the European Empires claimed independence and dozens of nation states were established in Asia and Africa. Yet, the decolonial momentum of this period has not brought an end to imperialism as a global phenomenon. The same period witnessed the construction of new imperial alliances, rivalries and expansion of their reach in search for oil and other commodities. This class focuses on the Mediterranean seascapes, lifeworlds and fields of extraction to investigate the post-WWII imperial polities and the socioeconomic problems that they produce. We explore how imperial epistemologies formed separate regional imaginaries in places like the Middle East, Southern Europe and North Africa. Then we ask whether or not the focus on the sea as a geographical force-field, a multispecies lifeworld and a site of connectivity helps us build critical epistemologies that shift away from the imperial lens. The class examines themes such as state, labor, gender, migration, floods, fires and earthquakes to interrogate the sedimentation of political and environmental problems in the Mediterranean.

While many genealogies of Black Studies depart from the formal institutionalization of Black Studies departments and programs in the latter half of the 20th Century, this course is differently attuned to the dialectic of Black thought and Black insurgency in which the latter-what C.L.R. James describes as a history of Pan-African revolt against the plantation and its afterlives-is always a precondition of the former. As a critical survey of said histories and the ideas derived from them, this course will examine the relationship between knowledge production (theory) and material struggle (praxis) in the Black Radical Tradition alongside adjacent but distinct political traditions such as Marxism and anarchism. Born out of a protracted ""state of emergency,"" the Black Radical Tradition permits us to appraise, critique, and confront the alarms raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and global climate collapse alongside settler colonialism and plantation slavery in the longue duree.

An archipelago in Oceania's sea of islands, Hawai'i has been locally constructed and globally consumed as a tropical paradise for pleasure and play, attracting tourists, settlers, corporations, and military forces to its shores. It is a fantasized paradise produced through the dispossession, elimination, appropriation, and exploitation of Indigenous people, institutions, worldviews, and practices.

Drawing from a range of global ethnographic examples, as well as from popular culture, literature, and other academic fields, we will think critically about everyday practices that are so often taken for granted. We will investigate the complex relationships that people make with everyday things and the roles they play in social life; how commodities can produce and reproduce social relationships and materialize claims about identity or status; fashion and its relationships to capitalism, gender, and appropriation; political and ecological aspects of consumption; and more. In doing so, we will attend to and practice some key approaches to doing anthropology, including ethnographic interviewing, observing, media ethnography, writing field notes, and turning them into a text. Students will write three short papers, describing the ""biography"" of an object, analyzing consumption in a popular culture ""text,"" and writing up original ethnographic data.

Drawing on cases from North America and Sub-Saharan Africa, we will study xenophobia at different points along its spectrum of intensity - from mass atrocities to the seemingly banal ways in which othering and exclusion are baked into everyday life. We will study each case in depth in its own right, as well as how it sits within broader experiences of exclusion and violence around the world and across time. In the course, we will explore theoretical debates surrounding nativism, autochthony, and different forms of nationalism, and the ways they relate to xenophobia. Scholars of migration and belonging have long shown that collective identities are constructed in large part in relation to an external other.

Some topics we will consider are: the origin of the concept of ""Latin"" America, Inter-Americanism and Pan-Americanism, transnational social movements and intellectual exchanges, migration, and racial and ethnic politics.",Course not offered in 24-25,"RDIN 26386, RDIN 36386, SPAN 26386, CRES 26386, SPAN 36386, LACS 26386, HIST 26321, LACS 36386",,Diana Schwartz Francisco
ANTH 23077,Indigenous Politics in Latin America. 100 Units.,This course examines the history of Indigenous policies and politics in Latin America from the first encounters with European empires through the 21st Century. Course readings and discussions will consider several key historical moments across the region: European encounters/colonization; the rise of liberalism and capitalist expansion in the 19th century; 20th-century integration policies; and pan-Indigenous and transnational social movements in recent decades. Students will engage with primary and secondary texts that offer interpretations and perspectives both within and across imperial and national boundaries.,Course not offered in 24-25,"LACS 26380, RDIN 26380, RDIN 36380, CRES 26380, GLST 26380, LACS 36380, HIST 26318, HIPS 26380",,Diana Schwartz Francisco
ANTH 23094,Development and Environment in Latin America. 100 Units.,"Description: This course will consider the relationship between development and the environment in Latin America and the Caribbean. We will consider the social, political, and economic effects of natural resource extraction, the quest to improve places and peoples, and attendant ecological transformations, from the onset of European colonialism in the fifteenth century, to state- and private-led improvement policies in the twentieth. Some questions we will consider are: How have policies affected the sustainability of land use in the last five centuries? In what ways has the modern impetus for development, beginning in the nineteenth century and reaching its current intensity in the mid-twentieth, shifted ideas and practices of sustainability in both environmental and social terms? And, more broadly, to what extent does the notion of development help us explain the historical relationship between humans and the environment?",Course not offered in 24-25,"LACS 36382, HIST 36317, CEGU 26382, HIST 26317, LACS 26382, GLST 26382, HIPS 26382, ENST 26382, GEOG 26382",,Diana Schwartz Francisco

ANTH 23301,Religion and Psychiatry. 100 Units.,"This course will investigate the many theoretical and practical problems which emerge where the domains of psychiatry and religion overlap. We will explore questions such as: What are the common realities that religious and psychiatric frameworks seek to explain? Are being ""divinely inspired"" and being ""mad"" mutually exclusive? How do religious and other cultural categories shape the development of what are called ""mental disorders""? Are cognitive behavioural therapists more effective than witchdoctors at restoring people to health? We will begin with a brief overview of the history of psychiatry, before analyzing a famous case of mass demonic possession in 17th century France. We will take several weeks to explore contemporary psychiatric diagnoses, contrasting how psychiatrists and religious authors describe similar symptoms in different ways. We will compare diverse therapeutic methods, modern and traditional, to ask what makes each of them effective or ineffective. Finally, we will survey proposed alternatives to the prevailing diagnostic frameworks within psychiatry, asking which, if any, our study of the overlapping domains of religion and psychiatry might lend support.",Spring,"HLTH 23300, COGS 26802, RLST 23300, CCTS 23300",,Owen Joyce-Coughlin
ANTH 23335,Racial France. 100 Units.,"Over the last two decades, questions of race, racial identity, and racial discrimination have come increasingly to the fore in France, despite (or because of) the country's prevailing rhetoric of colorblind indivisibility. These issues are becoming ever more pressing on a background of intensifying racisms and right-wing populisms in Europe. The purpose of this course is to offer analytical perspectives about these critical tensions and their ripples across the landscape of contemporary French politics. Using readings from a wide variety of fields (among others, anthropology, sociology, literature, philosophy, history, political science, and news media), we will unpack the discourses and lived experiences of race that have shaped the politics of national identity and difference in France since the late 18th century. We will see that the question of 'racial France' has been intimately bound up with the country's history of colonialism and decolonization, with its Republican ideology, with matters of law and government, with questions of citizenship, religion and sexuality, with recent debates on multiculturalism, and with white malaise and resentment stirred by the growth of right-wing extremisms. In the course of our examinations, we will also reflect on the specificity of race and racialization in France, and its differences from racecraft in the United States.",TBD,"ANTH 33335, FREN 33335, FREN 23335, CRES 23335",,Francois Richard
ANTH 23338,The Anthropology of Privacy. 100 Units.,"Over the past decade, increasingly invasive forms of digital surveillance have followed the internet into our phones, cars, homes, and public spaces. The uncertainties and anxieties thereby unleashed in everyday and national life include a widespread perception of privacy's impending ""death"". This course draws on history, philosophy, and anthropology to explore privacy as both object and engine of culture, and as a cultural lens on unfolding changes in contemporary American life. In the course, we will excavate the logics and historical projects that have privileged privacy as a keystone of American political cosmology, even while disavowing privacy's ongoing complicity in structures of oppression. We will trace how privacy's increasing entanglement with technology, speculative capital, and counter-terror imperatives shifts both the forms in which privacy appears in everyday life and its political capacities. Finally, to make sense of ongoing, technology-based reconfigurations in citizen/state/corporate relations, we will look to the public events around which privacy manifests as a social ""problem"" (e.g., Facebook's secret 2014 emotional manipulation study) and analyze the relative adequacy of the legal and technical measures being deployed on privacy's behalf.",,,,Lake Polan
ANTH 23342,Material Correlates: Comparing Archaeological Evidence and Interpretation in the Near East and Mesoa. 100 Units.,"Fundamentally, this course examines how archaeological knowledge of the past is a reflection of both the physical traces of former times and the epistemic and institutional traditions by which it is understood. This seminar is a comparative exploration of archaeological evidence and the interpretative frameworks used to investigate it. We will examine how archaeologists from different disciplinary and regional traditions identify and explain the past, highlighting shared tools and techniques alongside points of departure and contestation. Drawing primarily from the instructors' regions of expertise in the Near East and Mesoamerica, the course is structured around a series of thematic comparisons. What do archaeologists working in different parts of the world consider robust material evidence of the past? What factors influence how archaeologists categorize, analyze, and explain that evidence? Do archaeologists working in different regions approach bones, stones, metals, and ceramics in the same ways? How does an approach rooted in anthropological analogies differ from one grounded in historical sources? What traditional explanations and tropes might be accepted in one archaeological context, but seem entirely out of place in another?",,"NEAA 33342, ANTH 33342, NEAA 23342",,

ANTH 23507,Power and Responsibility in the Anthropocene. 100 Units.,"Humanity's immense impact on Earth's systems has led some scientists to claim that we have entered a new geological epoch: the Anthropocene. Humans' influence on Earth's landscape, climate system, and biodiversity inspires many to ask, in turn, What should be done about humankind's planetary powers? Some scholars and religious leaders claim that people should take responsibility and influence Earth's systems for good ends, while others argue that we should radically scale down such power. Still others suggest that the Anthropocene requires us to entirely revise our ideas of power and responsibility and even develop new religious sensibilities. Through discussions and focused writing assignments, students in this class will explore and evaluate these and additional responses to the Anthropocene, paying specific attention to how Anthropocene ethical thought wrestles with the place of religion on a changing planet. The course culminates in an extended examination of how Anthropocene discourse conceals racial antagonisms and contemporary decolonial struggles.",Spring,"RDIN 23507, HIPS 23570, GLST 23507, CEGU 23507, RLST 23507",,Colin Weaver
ANTH 23510,Ethics of Ethnographic Encounter. 100 Units.,"How can anthropological perspectives help us rethink issues of current global concern? We will be attending to critiques of ethnographic method: calls to decolonize the discipline, demands to make it more collaborative. At that level, we will be exploring anthropology as a distinctive way of engaging the world, and how the ethos of ethnography sits with the difference between scholarship and activism. At the same time, we will be considering what kind of light anthropology can shed on present-day problems such as the politics of indigeneity, scientific authority, environmental crisis, and interspecies relations.",TBD,RLST 23510,,William Mazzarella
ANTH 23616,Central Asia Past and Present/From Alexander the Great to Al Qaeda. 100 Units.,"Central Asia Past and Present serves as a multi-disciplinary course, spanning anthropology, history and political science. This course introduces students to the fluid, political-geographic concept of Central Asia as well as to the historical and cultural dimensions of this particular and oft-redefined world. My understanding of Central Asia comes from studies of ex-Soviet Central Asia, which includes five independent countries (since 1991) within central Eurasia--the former U.S.S.R. Thus the course encompasses Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan in addition to parts of northern Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and western China (Xinjiang/Sinkiang). Students will familiarize themselves with universal and divergent factors among the Central Asian peoples based on phenomena such as human migrations, cross-cultural influences, historical events, and the economic organization of peoples based on local ecology and natural boundaries. Working together and as individuals, we will study maps and atlases to gain a fuller understanding of historical movements and settlements of the Central Asian peoples.",,"ANTH 32206, NEHC 30160, NEHC 20160",,R.

We will compare Wakefield's ""scientific colonization"" in New Zealand, Gordon's social experiments and indentured labor in Fiji, and the plantations, American annexation, tourism, and the military in Hawai'i. We will compare the colonial experiences of the Maori, Hawaiians, and indigenous Fijians, and also those of the immigrant laborers and their descendants, especially white New Zealanders, the South Asians in Fiji, and the Japanese in Hawai'i.

ANTH 23803,Magical Politics. 100 Units.,"Following Donald Trump's election to the presidency in 2016, witches all over North America collaborated on spells to resist him and his politics by 'binding' his administration. Alt-right activists had already for some time been engaged in 'meme magic' against Trump's liberal critics. How can we begin to understand these magical interventions in present-day politics? Rather than presuming that 'magical politics' is a fringe or crackpot phenomenon, this class draws on activist, esoteric, and academic materials to suggest that our thinking about everyday life and ordinary politics can be fundamentally enlivened and enhanced by taking 'magic' seriously.",TBD,"CCCT 23803, RLST 28803",,William Mazzarella
ANTH 23809,"Visualization and Biology: Science, Culture, and Representation. 100 Units.","How do scientific images get made? This deceptively simple question lies at the heart of this course. Over three weeks at the MBL, we will examine the techniques, technologies, philosophies and histories of scientific image making, with a particular focus on marine biology. Rather than simply reading theories of visualization and representation, students will immerse themselves in the making of images themselves. Students will perform hands-on work with historical and contemporary theories and techniques of microscopy, taxonomy, anatomy, and specimen collecting. They will also examine the theoretical, philosophical, and ethical underpinnings of those practices. Through a combination of ethnographic (participant observation) and historical (archival) work, students will develop rich accounts of scientific visualization - from matters of objectivity and instrumentation, to problems of vision and the limits of (human) senses, to questions of aesthetics, abstraction, and representation. During the course, students will have the opportunity to work with Marine Biological Laboratory faculty, have access to laboratory and archives, and will develop new data and novel accounts of the social, cultural, and technical creation of scientific images.",Autumn,"ENST 25111, HIST 14904, HIPS 15100",Prerequisite: Consent Only.,Michael Paul Rossi
ANTH 23816,Farms as Factories: Industrial Ideals in 'Modern' Agriculture. 100 Units.,"Plants and animals are now produced in capital-intensive, factory-like settings. The industrialization of agriculture has not only transformed what we eat, but also the ecology of the globe and biology of its inhabitants. This course explores the logics, history, and consequences of an agricultural sector that simultaneously generates lagoons of pig manure, proprietary DNA, and monocropped landscapes. How does commoditizing wheat alter its value? How do pigs to change when they live their lives on concrete? What forms of care are needed to keep antibiotic-laden chickens alive? How does the industrial production of life rearrange 'modern' concepts of nature? The course situates these questions within a broader framework of capitalism and commoditization; we begin by studying the rationale of proto-industrial production on slave plantations, consider the results of agricultural 'modernization' in the 19th and 20th centuries, and analyze how social scientists have studied these processes. Then, we examine how agricultural products - plants and animals - have been physically altered to facilitate standardized production, and study how these shifts have changed the role of workers and social milieu of agrarian labor. In addition to contextualizing modern agricultural production, this class is an introduction to animal and plant studies, theories of capitalism and commodification, and environmental studies.",Autumn,ENST 23645,,Sandy Hunter

ANTH 23910,Holocaust Object. 100 Units.,"In this course, we explore various ontological and representational modes of the Holocaust material object world as it was represented during World War II. Then, we interrogate the post-Holocaust artifacts and material remnants, as they are displayed, curated, controlled, and narrated in the memorial sites and museums of former ghettos and extermination and concentration camps. These sites which-once the locations of genocide-are now places of remembrance, the (post)human, and material remnants also serve educational purposes. Therefore, we study the ways in which this material world, ranging from infrastructure to detritus, has been subjected to two, often conflicting, tasks of representation and preservation, which we view through a prism of authenticity. In order to study representation, we critically engage a textual and visual reading of museum narrations and fiction writings; to tackle the demands of preservation, we apply a neo-materialist approach. Of special interest are survivors' testimonies as appended to the artifacts they donated. The course will also equip you with salient critical tools for future creative research in Holocaust studies.",TBD,"ANTH 35035, ARCH 27019, HIST 33413, HIST 23413, JWSC 29500, REES 37019, REES 27019",,Bozena Shallcross
ANTH 23911,Anthropology of Religion. 100 Units.,"How do anthropologists study religion? This course is an introduction to classic concepts that have defined the social scientific study of religion such as ritual, taboo, transcendence, embodiment, and enchantment. To grasp how fieldwork is paired with theory, we will engage ethnographic writings on Orthodox Christianity in northern Ethiopia, Afro-Caribbean Santería in Chicago, and Islamic jinn veneration in Delhi India. We will further examine various themes in the socio-cultural inquiry of contemporary religion including asceticism, sexuality, sectarianism, and political theology.",Winter,"RLST 27650, AASR 34411",,A.

ANTH 23914,Whom am I to Judge? Relativism and Religious Difference. 100 Units.,"How do we evaluate people who are different from us? What grounds our evaluation of human behaviors or beliefs? At the end of the 20th century, comparative analyses of religious beliefs and ethics were heavily criticized for their ethnocentric tendencies; researchers were blamed for importing their own values on the ""other"". More recently, however, the pendulum seems to have swung in the other direction. Comparative religious ethicists often adopt a brand of liberal moral relativism. ""To each their own"" is their preferred mantra. This dramatic swing within the field of comparative religious ethics opens up questions for future study: Under what conditions can we praise or blame those who are different than us? What virtues of scholarship are necessary for quality comparative work? In this course we will learn about the field of comparative religious ethics and the perils and possibilities that accompany its intellectual projects. In addition to several theoretical texts, we will read two ethnographies (Fernando 2014 and Pandian 2009) that weave in and out of comparative religious ethics. These texts focus on themes of nationalism, post-colonialism, immigration, the production and regulation of religious subjects, and the limits of our judgments on the other.",Winter,RLST 24160,,Caroline Anglim

ANTH 23916,Race and Religion: Theorizing Blackness and Jewishness. 100 Units.,"Founded on ideals of universalism, pluralism and secularism, France and the United States are fraught with contradictions when it comes to race and religion. Which religions are accepted? Which religions are suspect? Is it minority that defines the difference-or only particular kinds of minority, such as race? To untangle the intersections of race and religion, we will examine Blackness and Jewishness as they are represented in political polemic, fiction, memoir and philosophy from the 1960s to the present. This course introduces students to the foundational concepts for the critical study of race and religion through exploring the constructions of Black and Jewish identity. We will examine the contradictions of secular politics and culture in France and the United States, and discuss how religion, race, and intersecting categories such as gender and sexuality, can become tools of critique. Readings include works by thinkers such as Césaire, Fanon, Memmi, Levinas and Foucault, along with literary classics by Nella Larsen and Sarah Kofman, and contemporary critical essays by Judith Butler, Christina Sharpe and Talal Asad.

ANTH 24100,In a world of give and take. Questioning value and its discontents. 100 Units.,"How does value make its way into the world? With what concepts and practices do individuals and groups ascribe value to the things they make, to the world around them, and to the lives they lead? Why do questions of politics and ethics (i.e., how to convene as a community and how to conduct ourselves as individuals) so frequently turn on disagreements over the having, holding, giving, and taking of value? This course addresses these questions with a specific focus on shifting understandings of nature, environment, and climate. First, and through readings in political economy and moral philosophy, students will acquire a repertoire for describing the material, symbolic, and semiotic dimensions of value. Then, we will use this repertoire to analyze contemporary texts that examine the critical yet ambivalent role that value plays in struggles over nature, environment, climate.

In this course, we will draw on anthropology, law, and allied disciplines to explore the ambiguous intersections of technological innovation and human rights. Through a series of case studies, the course will consider how new technologies and their allied knowledge practices call into question the foundational categories of human rights law, complicating understandings of the individual, person hood, family, and life. The course will further examine how emerging developments in biotechnology, information technology, robotics, and AI variously enhance and undermine the substantive protections of human rights, including the rights to health, privacy, freedom of expression, security, and indigenous knowledge.

ANTH 24304,Talking With Animals. 100 Units.,"All over the world, children have long learned the lessons of what it means to be human from what animals tell them. In addition to ventriloquizing non-human animals to socialize human ones, projects for facilitating cross-species communication abound. These projects reveal not only how people imagine their relations with other animals, but also how we conceive of the possibilities and limits of sign systems. And while many focus on talking with animals, others suggest that animals are effective communicators precisely because they lack language, raising fascinating questions about ideologies of (im)mediation. As we learn how Peruvian kids talk with llamas and American cowboys whisper to wild horses, and explore what spiders say and how apes read the human keepers who teach them to sign, this class explores how distinctions are drawn between human and non-human animals, as well as attempts to cross those divides through communicative forms and technologies.",TBD,,,E.

Despite assaults on the field from numerous quarters, psychoanalytic thinking remains central to the work of practitioners across an array of disciplines. After an introduction to key psychoanalytic concepts including the unconscious, repression, and transference, we will investigate some of the ways in which these ideas are mobilized within clinical practice, neuroscience, anthropology, education, philosophy, literary studies, and the visual arts through a series of lectures presented by specialists from these fields. Along the way, we will gain an appreciation for some of the ways in which psychoanalytic perspectives continue to inspire a variety of current scientific and humanistic projects.",Spring,BPRO 28400,PQ: Third or fourth-year standing.,"A.

ANTH 24320,Cultural Psychology. 100 Units.,"There is a substantial portion of the psychological nature of human beings that is neither homogeneous nor fixed across time and space. At the heart of the discipline of cultural psychology is the tenet of psychological pluralism, which states that the study of ""normal"" psychology is the study of multiple psychologies and not just the study of a single or uniform fundamental psychology for all peoples of the world. Research findings in cultural psychology thus raise provocative questions about the integrity and value of alternative forms of subjectivity across cultural groups. In this course we analyze the concept of ""culture"" and examine ethnic and cross-cultural variations in mental functioning with special attention to the cultural psychology of emotions, self, moral judgment, categorization, and reasoning.",Winter,"PSYC 33000, KNOW 31000, CHDV 21000, GNSE 31000, PSYC 23000, ANTH 35110, CRES 21100, CHDV 31000, AMER 33000, GNSE 21001",Undergraduates must be in third or fourth year.,R.

We will learn to historicize these concepts and explore alternative frameworks anthropologists have offered for studying Muslim societies. We will turn an ethnographic lens towards studies on the Islamic Revival in Egypt, Turkey, Europe, and East Asia in order to study how Muslims cultivate piety, relate to the unseen, and retain cultural ties alongside their religious identities. In the process, we will learn the ways they trouble conventional notions around women's agency, ideas around modernity's ""disenchantment,"" and secular conceptions of belief. We will then explore texts that indirectly problematize the anthropology of Islam's coordinates around orthopraxy, authority, and ritual. As we do so, we will interrogate the relationship between U.S. Blackness and Islam, religious piety and consumer capitalism, as well as transnationalism and incarceration. We will situate our readings and discussions within the broader political context of the Global War on Terror and secular governmentality, with a particular attention to questions of race, gender, and political struggle.",Spring,"RLST 27332, GNSE 27332, RDIN 24332",,Alexis Chavez
ANTH 24349,Human Rights and Postcolonial Politics. 100 Units.,"This class focuses on the history and theory of human rights by considering it as a quintessentially postcolonial political form. We consider how Euro-American genealogies of rights intersect and interact with trajectories of colonial rule and postcolonial politics. In the process, the question of rights itself comes to be posed afresh. Empirically, the class focuses on the histories and presents of India and South Africa. Both these countries underwent processes of constitutional decolonization. Thus, rights have a foundational place in both postcolonial polities. What does that mean? How does that create openings for the imaginations and instantiations of socially transformative policies? How does it lead to the endurance of traces and aspects of colonial government? What are the promises and limits of rights as we consider them in such historical and political contexts? In what ways are political struggles in these countries marked as being both for and against rights? In the process, how does our thinking and conceptualization of rights itself come to be at stake?",,HMRT 24349,,Kaushik Sunder Rajan
ANTH 24361,Anthropology of Art. 100 Units.,"This course offers an entry point into Anthropology of Art via a practical orientation to the ethnographic study of making and creating in our contemporary, globalized world. Pairing current foci within the subfield with methodological exercises in a series of discussion and practicum meetings, we will engage a range ethnographic works and conceptual frameworks for thinking about why and how making becomes meaningful (as Art, as social action, as therapeutic, etc.) in social context. How are persons, communities, institutions, or nations around the world today using art to accomplish social projects? How does someone become recognized as ""creative"" in professional contexts? How do images or media become associated with kinds of people, places, or ideas? We will reflect on how anthropologists are approaching questions like these by drawing on empirical cases like those of art schooling, media industries and the international art market; the arts-based intervention of NGOs, activists, and art therapists; DIY and indigenous communities, artist-researchers, and folkloric performance. The course begins and ends with a discussion of how disciplines of fine art and anthropology mutually produce status and knowledge with/for one another, challenging the category of ""art"" and rebuilding an anthropology of art concerned with the pragmatic dimensions of making and creating.

ANTH 24702,Un/Making Citizenship: The Politics of the Intimate. 100 Units.,"The state is like a gravitational force that holds people in relation to itself, tugging and turning each person to different degrees. Citizenship is the mediation of that relationship. In this course, we examine different dimensions of citizenship across the life course, considering the ways people are formed into certain kinds of subjects. We ask: how and why are intimate life events of interest not only to those involved, but also to governing authorities? From the governance of conception and birth, to the (non)conferral of legal identities, the state manages legitimacy through documents like birth certificates, whose contents or absence can shape a person's entire life trajectory. In childhood, schools work to transform children into certain kinds of future citizens. From legal adulthood's gradual accrual of rights -- to vote, to have sex, to drink, to stand trial -- to old age and long after death, citizenship extends beyond the lifecourse. Over the course of the quarter, we investigate the ways people negotiate attempts to transform them into citizens, examining in particular how citizenship is mediated in relation to religion, sexuality, migration, disability, marriage, pregnancy, old age, and death.",TBD,"CHDV 24702, GNSE 24704",,Kathryn Takabvirwa

This course will investigate the phenomenon of QAnon through the lens of New Religious Movements (NRMs)--seeking to understand the complex interplay of factors that incites people to become immersed in these groups. Using examples from American New Religious Movements of the 20th century such as Scientology, the Rajneesh movement, and Jonestown, we will delve into the history of these groups in order to examine the motivations that drive individuals into these ""fringe"" religious movements. In the process, we will interrogate the usefulness of such labels as ""religion"" and ""cult,"" and ultimately hope to better understand how power, race, gender, and practices of dissimulation play active roles in both these new religious movements and within QAnon.",Autumn,"RLST 28991, AMER 28991, SOCI 20540",,Marielle Harrison

Or is it something that at times requires the state's intervention? Does religion represent the last vestiges of the premodern world, or is it something that is integral to modern life? To answer these questions, we will call on anthropologists and other social scientists and theorists to understand, first, what is ""religion,"" and then what is, can be, or should be its relationship to gender, the nation, and the modern state in various historical and geographical locations, with particular attention to the Middle East and South Asia.",Not offered 2022-2023,"GLST 25630, RLST 26630",,Callie Maidhof
ANTH 25199,"Sensing Bodies, Sensing the World: Anthropology of Embodiment and Perception. 100 Units.","In this seminar, we will learn about anthropological understandings of embodiment and perception while engaging in activities that encourage us to attune to our bodies and sensory worlds. Drawing on literature and theoretical approaches from scholars including anthropologists, philosophers, and historians, we will consider questions such as: How do we use our senses to make sense of our bodies and the world around us? How do cultural and historical beliefs and practices shape sensory experiences and conceptions of the body? The readings, which will focus primarily on phenomenological, biopolitical, and posthuman approaches, will challenge divides between biology and culture, body and mind, human and nature, and self and other. As we explore these themes, we will discuss methods of sensory ethnography and work toward our own sensory ethnographies or creative projects. Throughout the course, we will relate the readings to our own embodied experiences, gaining a greater appreciation of the role of the senses (and the body) in shaping our understanding of the world and our place within it. We will use theory to think through our own embodiment and sensory perception of the world and vice versa, prioritizing creative practices and challenging assumptions at methodological as well as theoretical levels.",Winter,"HLTH 25199, CHDV 25199",,L.

ANTH 25211,Feminism(s) and Anthropology. 100 Units.,"This course examines the fraught yet generative relation between various movements of feminism and the discipline of anthropology. Both feminism(s) and anthropology emerged in the 19th century as fields invested in thinking ""the human"" through questions of alterity or Otherness. As such, feminist and anthropological inquiries often take up shared objects of analysis--including nature/culture, kinship, the body, sexuality, exchange, value and power-even as they differ in their political and scholarly orientations through the last century and a half. Tracking the emergence of feminisms and anthropology as distinct fields of academic discourse on the one hand and political intervention on the Other, we will pursue the following lines of inquiry: 1) a genealogical approach to key concepts and problem-spaces forged at the intersection of these two fields 2) critical analysis of the relation of feminist and postcolonial social movements to the professionalizing fields of knowledge production (including Marxist inspired writing on women and economy, Third World feminism and intersectionality, and feminist critiques of science studies) and 3) a reflexive contemporary examination of the way these two strands of thought have come together in the subfield of feminist anthropology and the continual frictions and resonances of feminist and anthropological approaches in academic settings and in the larger world (e.g., #MeToo, sex positive activism, queer politics, feminist economics).",Winter,"GNSE 32103, CHDV 32103, CHDV 22103, ANTH 32910, GNSE 20143",3rd and 4th year undergraduates only.

Objects around us are imbued with meaning through their design, construction, use, and disuse. Architecture, art, photography, clothing, quilts, toys, food, and even the body have all been used to define groups of people. Combining secondary literature, theory, documentary evidence, and material culture, this course guides students as they ask questions about how ideologies of race and gender are produced, how they are both historically specific and constantly in flux, and how human interaction with the material world creates, challenges, and changes their construction. The primary course objectives are to (1) provide students with an introduction to material culture as a theory and methodology and (2) teach them how to apply it to research on ideologies of gender and race in history.",Winter,"HIST 27414, GNSE 27530, CRES 27530, ARTH 27530",,

Anthropologists have long studied aspects of lived experience of central concern to human rights, including state violence, cultural difference, and structural inequality. In recent decades, they have focused increasing attention on the institutions and practices through which activists adopt and rework human rights concepts in local political and social struggles.

We will consider interest in sex as a motivating factor in the ethnographic enterprise and, reading studies on everything from desire, kink, and play to procreation, heritance and power, will examine complex and social construction of sexed, gendered, and raced selves and Others. How has ethnographic research contested the ubiquitous salience of male/female dichotomies, of patriarchy, and of the cross-cultural, trans-historical applicability of concepts like 'third gender?

Infectious disease, data, global capital, and even ""culture"" seem to travel in the blink of an eye. At the same time, we're witnessing the fortification of borders, and a resurgence of rightwing ethnonationalist populism on both sides of the Atlantic. Borders take on new significance national debates and security policy, and for those who rarely come into contact with borders, they may seem like mere metaphor for how a nation positions itself with regard to immigration, public health, and trade. But beyond the party platforms of politicians in the world's capitols, borders are very real places, constituted by the practices of state and non-state actors alike, and creating new forms of life in response to the technologies that police them. In this course, we will take an anthropological view of borders in order to understand how they are created, policed, and inhabited, following and bucking trends in the micropractices of military, police, and bordercrossers both legal and illegal.",Spring,"GLST 25701, CHST 25701",,Callie Maidhof

What social variables influence and shape 'real' markets and market activities? 'If you are so smart, why aren't you rich?' is a question economists have been asked in the past. Why isn't it easy to make money in financial areas even if one knows what economists know about markets, finance and the economy? And why, on the hand, is it so easy to get rich for some participants? Perhaps the answer is the real markets are complex social and cultural institutions which are quite different form organizations, administrations and the production side of the economy. The course provides an overview over social and cultural variables and patterns that play a role in economic behavior and specifically in financial markets.

How is it related to value? How is it different from money? How does it work to organize social relations? In what forms, and through what institutional structures, does it materialize? How does it reflect in modes and relations of production? How is it governed, and what is its relation to the political? This course will enter into such questions, in the first instance, through a reading of Karl Marx. It will subsequently traverse a heterodox genealogy of Marxist social thought (with some emphasis on French theorists), in order to understand how a method of analysis developed to come to terms with nineteenth century European industrial capitalism might help us understand contemporary worlds of extraction, logistics and finance in comparative perspective. We will consider how capital is racialized and gendered, how it has expanded and mutated across place and over time, and what it means that we live in a time today when it is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism.",Winter.

ANTH 25720,Ethnographic Writing: Practices of Research and Representation. 100 Units.,"This course gives students opportunities to develop their own craft of ethnography through hands-on research and writing and in-depth explorations of recent ethnographic work. Ethnography, ""the writing of a people,"" by definition, refers to groups of people as its object and to processes through which an ethnographer attempts to represent such groups. It also refers to academic texts that are the product of an ethnographer's representational efforts. In this course, students will engage with ethnography multivalently - as research practice, analytical generalization, and literary product. We will reflect upon processes of representation through which ethnographers apply their findings to groups (implicitly or explicitly) and the choices and interpretations they make along the way. Some questions we will ask are: How does the ethnographer deploy particular signifiers, such as modes of communication, spatial and architectural configurations, and historical contexts to make arguments? How is language used to represent experience convincingly? With these questions in mind, we will approach book and article-length ethnographies focusing on four expansive themes - migration, global interconnectivity, nation-states, and neoliberalism.

Drawing upon a life course model, we will study how different cultures and social groups seek to structure the individual's life in relation to the wider society by creating socially constructed stages, age cohorts, and generations. We will consider how different social factors including gender, sexuality, race, and socioeconomic status may disrupt an individual's ability to follow an idealized life course. An examination of the cultural assumptions surrounding aging in the United States will illustrate how ageism and age-stratification affect social relations across society and make certain lives more ""successful"" than others. The course will focus on older age and later life as a method for exploring how individuals make sense of their life experiences through narrative construction, the accumulation of disadvantage over the life course, and how historical and cultural shifts are disrupting established roles and relationships for the elderly across the world.

Knowledge institutions are particularly challenged to find adequate responses to changing notions of authorship as the mainstreaming of 'artificial' texts, audio-visual artifacts, and code is transforming our paradigms of communication in real-time. This course offers a survey of scholarship from the nascent field of critical AI studies to investigate the impact of AI, machine learning, and big data on knowledge production, representation, and consumption. In addition to theoretical discussions, we will conduct research-creation experiments aimed at documenting and evaluating emerging methods of AI-augmented content creation across text, image, and sound. Prospective students should demonstrate a substantial interest in media art and design and its connections to digital humanities, critical theory, and pedagogy. Experience with artistic and/or engineering practice is a plus.

ANTH 26202,Language in Culture in the Technological Age. 100 Units.,"How are contemporary global communication technologies and the rapid rise of large-scale generative communicative models transforming how we use and understand language? This interdisciplinary seminar course explores the intersections of these technological advancements with the semiotic and discursive analysis of communication in sociocultural life-a methodology developed within linguistic anthropology and sociolinguistics since the 1980s. We will investigate topics such as how digital and AI-driven environments interact and mediate communication, power dynamics, and institutional structures; how contemporary communicative technology reshapes discursive practices and, in turn, is influenced by them; how political economy underpins and shapes emerging forms of communicative labor; and how diverse communities negotiate, adapt, or re-create their linguistic practices in response to various existing and emerging forms of globalized media. Particularly, we will explore the application of theories and concepts from linguistic anthropology, pragmatics, and sociolinguistics to analyze and reflect on recent textual and discursive materials arising from generative AI and new forms of human-machine interaction. Readings and materials will be drawn from linguistic anthropology, sociolinguistics, cognitive science, computer science, the history of science, and Science Studies.

ANTH 26330,Making the Maya World. 100 Units.,"What do we know about the ancient Maya? Pyramids, palaces, and temples are found from Mexico to Honduras, texts in hieroglyphic script record the histories of kings and queens who ruled those cities, and painted murals, carved stone stelae, and ceramic vessels provide a glimpse of complex geopolitical dynamics and social hierarchies. Decades of archaeological research have expanded that view beyond the rulers and elites to explore the daily lives of the Maya people, networks of trade and market exchange, and agricultural and ritual practices. Present-day Maya communities attest to the dynamism and vitality of languages and traditions, often entangled in the politics of archaeological heritage and tourism. This course is a wide-ranging exploration of ancient Maya civilization and of the various ways archaeologists, anthropologists, linguists, historians, and indigenous communities have examined and manipulated the Maya past. From tropes of long-hidden mysteries rescued from the jungle to New Age appropriations of pre-Columbian rituals, from the thrill of decipherment to painstaking and technical artifact studies, we will examine how models drawn from astrology, ethnography, classical archaeology and philology, political science, and popular culture have shaped current understandings of the ancient Maya world, and also how the Maya world has, at times, resisted easy appropriation and defied expectations.",TBD,"ANTH 36330, LACS 36330, CEGU 26330, LACS 26330",,Sarah Newman

In this way, we will gain a greater facility in not only using these concepts and methods, but in thinking how to extend them into new empirical problem spaces. This quarter, our main themes will be: grammar, reference, and relativity; the acting and affected body; politics beyond identity; and digital life. By considering how linguistic anthropology has and has not been able to expand into these areas, we add to our semiotic toolkit and get a handle on what it means to do semiotic analysis.

ANTH 27445,"Whose Hybridity?: ""Mixing"" Language, Race, and Identity. 100 Units.","Throughout the modern world, members of racial, ethnic, and other groups perform their identities, in part, through the use of multiple languages or linguistic sub-varieties. It is a commonplace assumption that some of these performed identities-and their linguistic modes of expression-are ""hybrid"" or ""mixed."" Whether viewed as a cause for celebration or alarm, such assumptions often rely on the idea of previously ""pure"" things that were later made ""hybrid."" In various accounts in a range of media, ""hybridity"" spells the end of desirable ways of life, even the ""natural order of things."" In other accounts, ""hybridity"" is celebrated for producing novel relations between discrete categories, practices, and identifications. Yet upon closer inspection, even such supposedly ""pure"" categories themselves frequently turn out to be anything but ""pure."" This course will critically explore how ""hybridity"" is constructed as a matter of concern across a range of intellectual-, geopolitical-, cultural-, and media contexts. It focuses on language as a privileged marker of and resource in identity-construction, both self and other. This class uses theories and methods from anthropology, sociolinguistics, history, and sociology to explore how ""hybridity"" can be-and has been-used to construct social boundaries, exclusions, and erasures as much as solidarities, inclusions, and recognitions.

Students will examine the intersection of race and religion as it applies to the construction of Muslim identity and alterity in the Western imagination. We will explore the remarkable consistency across centuries of the threatening, menacing, barbaric and uncivilized Muslim ""Other"". The course centers around these Orientalist constructions and will explore the power structures, colonial modalities, epistemological frameworks, and ideological assumptions that perpetuate the racialization of Islam and Muslims within the United States and abroad. This course ultimately aims to uncover potentials for resistance, recovery and renewal through the politics and praxis of decoloniality. Students will gain familiarity with decolonial theory and practices, as well as the important project of 'epistemic delinking' as it is framed by contemporary scholars intent on challenging, possibly undoing and remapping the Muslim experience within global liberal political modernity.",Winter,"NEHC 39030, NEHC 29030, RDIN 39030, RDIN 29030, KNOW 39030, RLST 29030, ISLM 39030, ANTH 39030",,Maliha Chishti

ANTH 29068,Christianity and Consumer Culture in the United States. 100 Units.,"In the United States, everything is for sale-including religion. Religious books, objects, and films are produced and marketed to recruit converts and to entertain and edify adherents. Churches can be seen as commodities as people ""shop"" for a new congregation or sect. Some scholars have suggested that consumption itself has become a religious act, with its own rites, rituals, and promises of salvation. In this course we will explore the intersecting histories of Christianity and consumer culture in the US from the late nineteenth century to the present day. Reading classic texts in history and sociology, as well as more contemporary scholarship on American consumer culture, we will attend to the questions that consumer culture poses for American Christians and for scholars of religion. Has consumer culture contributed to the secularization of American society? Has Christianity been corrupted by consumer culture? Can Christians redeem the marketplace? How can the study of religion help us understand our culture of consumption, and how can consumerism help us understand religion?",Autumn,"RLST 29068, AMER 29068, HIST 27721",,Hannah Ozmun

Drawing on historical case studies, feminist theory, and postcolonial studies, this course will cover a broad range of empires and colonies to explore the mutually constitutive relationship between colonization and ideologies and practices of gender, sex, and kinship. Analyzing case studies predominately from the Atlantic World (with attention to colonies elsewhere), we will explore topics such as the emergence of colonial gender ideologies, gender and colonial governance, family life and kinship strategies, the intersectionality of gender and sexuality with race and class, queerness and queer lives, the politics of sex work and reproduction, and gendered migrations across empires.",Autumn,"ANTH 39109, RDIN 39109, RDIN 29109, GNSE 23174, GNSE 39109, MAPS 39109, SOCI 30346, HIST 29109, HIST 39109",,"Lyons, Deirdre"
ANTH 29300,Asceticism: Forming the Self. 100 Units.,"In recent decades scholars of the pre-modern period have turned to the body as a site of renewed historical inquiry. Within the study of religion, this shift has reanimated discussions around asceticism as a particularly potent technē for self-fashioning. Nevertheless, scholars have struggled to theorize asceticism across religious traditions. This signature course, taught by two scholars working in disparate historical periods and religious traditions (early Christianity and medieval Indian religious literature), explores how gender theory has engaged ascetic practices for understanding the body and human potential. Students will engage asceticism as a series of techniques or forms of life that envision the sexed and gendered human body as the horizon of corporeal expression and personal imagination. Asceticism serves as a neat conceptual device, allowing us to toggle between the mind and body while tackling questions that fall within the liminal space between them, including debates around gender, sexuality, sovereignty, and biopower. Students along with the instructors will contend with the challenges and opportunities of transnational and transhistorical feminist and queer inquiry as we traverse across the boundaries of tradition, language, and culture.

ARCH 11800,Physics and Contemporary Architecture. 100 Units.,"Architectural structures form the built environment around us and in many ways create the backbone of our civilization. They push the limits of form and function on the largest human scales, often leading to iconic masterpieces that symbolize the aesthetics as well as the technical achievements of a period. Many architectural advances have been made possible by breakthroughs in the science of materials, which then led to innovation in construction and fabrication techniques. This course will introduce the physics principles that have enabled some of the most innovative architecture of our time. This course will take key ideas and tools from physics and demonstrate their power and relevance in a broader context familiar from everyday experience. The course will challenge students to recognize physics concepts in the built structures that make up the urban environment we live in. Chicago is a most appropriate place for this study; it was the birthplace of the first skyscraper, and ever since it has played an internationally celebrated role in pushing the limits of the architectural state of the art. A long succession of renowned Chicago architects and structural engineers has turned this city into a premier laboratory for architectural innovation.

They will study early responses to modernism and modernization in the city by figures like William Blake, Frederick Engels, Henry James, Ezra Pound, and Virginia Woolf before moving on to contemporary writers such as R. Murray Schafer, who apprehends the city through ""earwitnessing"" of noise pollution, and Bhanu Kapil, who recalls the race riots of the 1970s against the backdrop of the Nestle factory on the site of King Henry VIII's hunting grounds. Students will be exposed first-hand to how London is read by writers confronting planetary and political crisis through meetings with living publishers, authors, and art collectives like the Museum of Walking, grappling with the continual metamorphosis of the landscape-and through a sequence of on-site visits and psychogeographical experiments, they will have the opportunity to respond to the city in their own writing across a range of genres.

The challenges of energy, transportation, food production and distribution, shelter are the IN and are, typically, the focus of architecture and its related disciplines. What about the OUT? Fuel emissions, food waste, human waste (solid and liquid), human remains, medical waste, thermal by-products of heating, cooling and manufacture, not to mention building waste to produce housing for 10 billion are the focus of this studio. As we urbanize, as cities expand, as the space for containing waste is ever more remote and the waste itself ever more copious, how do we manage, control or even understand the problem? This course will look at the challenges facing our cities as both recursive and emergent. The scale of these issues is of unprecedented magnitude, though not new in principle.

The purpose of this course is two-fold: 1) to introduce students to selected architectural episodes across time and space; and 2) to demonstrate that modernity as a concept is deeply charged with power dynamics. Indeed, the idea of modernity systematically includes a strong delineation of its margins: the people, cultures, and places that have been portrayed as lacking the modern mind, techniques, or esthetics. In this respect, modernity and its antonyms are often inseparable, like two sides of the same coin.

We will also pay particular attention to modes of opposition pursued by residents and their historical impact toward the region's decolonization. Moments of heightened historical consequence, such as independentist guerrillas' strategic use of selected architectural spaces, will be thoroughly discussed.

We will examine the lives and works of women who have managed to attend architecture schools, despite historical gender-based exclusion or restriction on enrollment, as well as those who found impactful ways to play architectural roles without academic training. We will pay particular attention to how these protagonists add necessary complexity to the modernist canon. The course will start with a first module on positionality (women as architects, women as clients, and women as residents) followed by a second module with a biographical scope (Minnette De Silva, Eileen Gray, bell hooks, and Sibyl Moholy-Nagy).",Spring,"GNSE 20145, ARTH 17781",,J.

ARCH 17915,Women's Work. 100 Units.,"As a haptic art, an art experienced through touch as well as the other senses, architecture operates at multiple scales: that of hand, building, city. The scale of the hand gives the most direct access to architecture and its furnishings: think of a handrail, a chair, a textile, a brick pattern, a wood detail. This is the realm of craft in architecture and was, for decades, the realm inhabited and ruled by women practitioners. Women designed furniture, made drawings, wove textiles, produced pottery and glasswork as a means of expression within the male world of architectural practice. As an introduction to the study of architecture, craft entails applying principles of proportion, scale, tactility, precision, materiality, and assembly; in this way, craft is a microcosm of architecture. Through a series of projects and readings centered around the craft arts and the women who advanced them, this studio course will introduce students to small-scale making and translate that process to larger scales. Students will undertake two investigations: the first a series of small craft objects and a set of orthographic drawings describing the making process, the second a spatial analysis and workspace for a craft practitioner.",Autumn,"GNSE 17915, ARTH 17915","While this class does not require prior experience, all ARCH studio courses require consent.

ARCH 20170,"Pandemics, Urban Space, and Public Life. 100 Units.","Much of the cultural vibrance, economic strength, and social innovation that characterizes cities can be credited to their density. Put simply, cities bring people together, and togetherness allows for complex and fruitful exchange. But togetherness also brings risks, notably from infectious disease. A pandemic feeds on propinquity. ""Social distance,"" while a short-term public health imperative, is antithetical to the very idea of the urban. In this seminar, we will explore these competing tensions in light of current and past disease outbreaks in urban settings. Drawing on a range of texts from history, design theory, sociology, and anthropology, as well as cultural artifacts like film, graphic memoir, and photography, we will engage questions like: How are the risks of contagion balanced with the benefits of density? How are such risks distributed throughout society? What creative responses have architects, urban designers, and planners brought to this challenge? Most importantly, how can we respond constructively to the challenge of pandemic to create cities where the benefits of togetherness are maximized, perhaps even improved on compared with the pre-outbreak condition?

ARCH 20241,Architecture and Value. 100 Units.,"This course is an investigation of architecture as a ""value-added"" proposition, looking at works and practice with regard to the marketpace. While architecture is often considered for its aesthetic and cultural benefit, here the issue studied is how architecture and architects create or improve value. Investigation begins with the normative, understanding the role of money in architectural practice, construction and development. Typically value in the profession is measured through the lenses of efficiency and economy, and architects operate within these traditional parameters. Included here is the important relationship between time and money in projects. Having defined the normative, work then shifts to be more progressive, with study of new responses to emerging markets, and alternative pathways with architects working directly as contractors or developers. Student work will investigate different solutions, working to produce both a research paper and a studio-type presentation.

Building upon urban sociology, planning theory and history as well as urban social science and environmental studies, we explore the emergence, development and continual transformation of urban planning in relation to changing configurations of capitalist urbanization, modern state power, sociopolitical insurgency and environmental crisis. Following an initial exploration of divergent conceptualizations of ""planning"" and ""urbanization,"" we investigate the changing sites and targets of planning; struggles regarding the instruments, goals and constituencies of planning; the contradictory connections between planning and diverse configurations of power in modern society (including class, race, gender and sexuality); and the possibility that new forms of planning might help produce more socially just and environmentally sane forms of urbanization in the future.",Winter,"PLSC 30521, SOCI 20521, GEOG 20521, PBPL 20521, PLSC 20521, ENST 20521, CHST 20521, SOCI 30521, PPHA 30521, CEGU 20521, KNOW 30521",,N.

ARCH 20685,Material Narratives. 100 Units.,"This studio explores architecture and design thinking through the lens of building materials--wood, masonry, concrete, metal, glass, and sustainable products. Our focus is on how designers and architects think about materials, how they use them in their work, and how materials can play a principal role in the design process. The larger studio project is to design a pavilion somewhere on campus using what we learn and the language of materials to tell a story. There will be an emphasis on using physical models, along with sketching and drawing, to investigate, develop and communicate our ideas. A few off-campus trips to buildings around Chicago during seminar sessions will require some travel before and after class.",Spring,"CHST 20685, ARTH 20685","While this class does not require prior experience, all ARCH studio courses require consent.

What is the cultural contribution of Armenians to their neighbors and overall world heritage? This crash-course will try to answer these and many other similar questions while surveying Armenian history and elements of culture (mythology, religion, manuscript illumination, art, architecture, etc.). It also will discuss transformations of Armenian identity and symbols of 'Armenianness' through time, based on such elements of national identity as language, religion, art, or shared history. Due to the greatest artistic quality and the transcultural nature of its monuments and artifacts, Armenia has much to offer in the field of Art History, especially when we think about global transculturation and appropriation among cultures as a result of peoples' movements and contacts.

Working both individually and together, we will use our surroundings at Taliesin to tackle five short projects, increasing in scale, from the tiniest architectural details up through consideration of city and region. As part of the latter portion of the course, we will also consider the Driftless region of Wisconsin specifically, and issues facing this unique rural area in 2023, including environmental challenges, questions of housing, and rural foodways. Typical days will include studio time in the Hillside studio, ample exploration of the Taliesin grounds both programmed and free, conversations with guests familiar with the work of Frank Lloyd Wright and others who spent time at Taliesin, excursions across the Driftless region (including additional buildings designed by Wright and others close to him), and a modest amount of work helping to maintain the Taliesin site.",Autumn,"CEGU 20704, ENST 20704, ARTH 20704, ARTH 30704",,

Belgrade/Sarajevo/Zagreb. 100 Units.,"The freedom to make and remake our cities (and ourselves) is one of the most precious yet most neglected of the human rights,"" argues David Harvey. In this course, we use an urban studies lens to explore the complex history, social fabric, architecture, infrastructure, and cultural transformation of the former Yugoslav capitals. Since their inception, these cities have relied on multifaceted exchanges of peoples and political projects, forms of knowledge, financial and cultural capital, means of production, and innovative ideas. Among others, these exchanges produced two phenomena, Yugoslav architecture, embodying one of the great political experiments of the modern era, and the Non-Aligned Movement, as explored in recent documentary films (Turajlić 2023), museum exhibits (MoMA 2018, ""Toward a Concrete Utopia: Architecture in Yugoslavia 1948-1980""), and monographs (Tito in Africa: Picturing Solidarity). Drawing on anthropological theory and ethnography of the city, we consider processes of urban destruction and renewal, practices of branding spaces and identities, metropolitan citizenship, arts and design, architectural histories and styles, and the broader politics of space. The course is complemented by cultural and historical media, guest speakers, and virtual tours.

ARCH 22015,Dialogues:The Intersections of Tradition and Modernity in Contemporary Iranian Art and Architecture. 100 Units.,"This studio critically explores the dialogues between tradition and modernity in contemporary Iranian art, architecture, and material culture. Through studying Iran's architectural heritage alongside emerging design practices, students will undertake projects that investigate how art and architecture can reinterpret the past to encounter the current political and economic landscapes. The studio will delve into recent buildings and artifacts created by Iranian architects and artists who actively engage with the discourse surrounding an ""Iranian modernity."" We will specifically review the works of an emerging generation of artists and architects whose practices are instrumental in shaping cultural scenarios in Iran today. The studio involves two design projects, one at the scale of an object, and the other at the scale of a building. Through these projects, students will explore the politics and poetics of contemporary Iranian art and architecture, thinking about the local and transnational trajectories within the broader global arena.

In this course, we will take gender relations and sexuality as our primary concern and as a constitutive aspect of social relations that vitally shape cities and urban life. We will examine how gender is inscribed in city landscapes, how it is lived and embodied in relation to race, class, and sexuality, and how it is (re)produced through violence, inequality, and resistance. Over the course of the quarter, we will draw on an interdisciplinary scholarship that approaches the central question of how and why thinking about urban life in relation to gender and sex matters.",Spring,"SOCI 28088, GLST 22105, ENST 12105, GNSE 12105",,Sneha Annavarapu

There will be some readings, but the primary input will be from riding-from seeing things at street level and speaking with people who are committed to living in places that often have been abandoned by others. We can read and theorize about the community surrounding us, but the premise in this class is that our work should begin with experience in that world, with direct contact and in conversation. My approach in this class is less to teach than to lead you to where things are waiting to be learned and to people who can teach you about their world better than I. Some of the themes we will cover include land rights and exploitation, architecture, town planning, placemaking, urban farming and ecology, sustainability, grass roots organization, labor rights and exploitation, immigration, social work, and street art. Each ride is organized around a set of key concerns and includes a conversation with a local insider who can help us better understand them.",,"CHST 22211, ENST 22211, KNOW 22211, CEGU 32211, CEGU 22211",,William Nickell

Or that millions of migratory birds stop by the city's lakefront each year? Urban centers, like Chicago, are increasingly vital in their ability to support biodiversity as it declines in other habitats across the globe. Through site visits to centers that research and rehabilitate urban wildlife, discussions with wildlife biologists and urban planners, and firsthand observations of our wild neighbors, this course will explore what it means to live alongside animals in an urban setting. Readings and discussions will evaluate the environmental history of Chicago and the many species which call it home to understand how city parks, boulevards, and cemeteries have become thriving ecosystems. This historical background will serve as a foundation for students to think critically about the ways in which cities plan for their wild inhabitants. Using methods from the environmental humanities and animal studies, we will ask questions not only about the ways in which urban structures have impacted wildlife in Chicago, but also about how wild animals have shaped Chicago and its human inhabitants. The course will include site visits to and guest speakers from institutions like the Max McGraw Wildlife Foundation, US Army Corps of Engineers, DuPage County Conservation Center at Willowbrook Forest Preserve, the City of Chicago, Lincoln Park Zoo, and the Field Museum.",,"CEGU 22302, CHST 22302",,

Holding the bulk of our classes out of doors, we will move through the city seeking out and documenting traces of the city's foundations in phenomena such as the filling in of swamp; the river as pipeline; and the creation of transportation and industrial infrastructure--all with uneven effects on human and nonhuman inhabitants. Coursework will combine readings in history and theory of the Anthropocene together with examples of how artists and activists have made the Anthropocene visible, tangible, and audible, providing forums for playful documentation and annotations as we draw, score, map, narrate, sing, curate and collate our sensory experience of the Anthropocene into a final experimental book project.

ARCH 22811,Experiments in Digital Mapping: Reconstructing the Early Modern City. 100 Units.,"On the one hand, this course explores the cartographic imagination in the early modern period, focusing primarily on developments in cartographic representation in Italy. These spatial experiments were crucial in the formation of knowledge about cities and urban societies and they have left a rich visual record of built environment from the 15th to the 17th centuries. Through a range of readings that take maps, cartography, and space as their subject to study, we will explore the methods crating a spatial history of the early period. On the other hand, this course will also allow students to experiment in digital techniques of mapping historical space through a collective project in which we will all be learning to geo-reference historical maps of Florence to trace the city's urban morphology across several centuries and, at the same time, explore ways of interpreting the past through such cartographic expressions.

Weekly lectures will introduce major themes and theoretical debates, paired with hands-on lab tutorials exploring a selection of methods in conventional and experimental geographic visualization. Thematically, the course will be organized around critical interpretations of the Anthropocene, a concept designating the epoch in which anthropogenic activities are recognized as the dominant force of planetary climatic and ecological change. We will present these interpretations through modules structured around different conceptual paradigms and alternative epochal designations (e.g. the Urbanocene, the Capitalocene, the Plantationocene). Through weekly lab exercises and a final, synthetic project, the course will move from critically analyzing prevalent theoretical frameworks, geospatial data, and associated visualization techniques to creatively visualizing critical alternatives. Students will learn how to construct visual narratives through a variety of spatial media (e.g. maps, diagrams, visual timelines), scales (e.g. bodies, neighborhoods, landscapes, the planetary), and techniques/platforms (e.g. GIS, web mapping, basic programming language tools, and vector/raster visualization programs).",Winter,"ENST 23517, ARTV 20665, CEGU 23517, MADD 13517",,"Alexander Arroyo, Grga Basic"

Drawing on both Chicago and other places (not just urban) that individual students know well, we will dream both big and small, search both present and past, and tap precisely into both what we dream and what we experience... seeking not to dictate what the city will be, but to use these different modes of understanding to expand our sense of what a city can be. Necessarily, we'll grapple with difficult contradictions cities pose, our most central personal assumptions about spaces and places, and with questions of how, especially in present-day capitalism, cities change. We take as given the inevitable gap between how places actually evolve and how, perhaps, they could, and use that gap as a site for the imagination to step in, while also confronting the hubris of imagining cities real. The studio work will proceed in three stages: individually developing an alternate vision for a place you know well, at a historical moment of your choice... then breaking each others' plans... and finally using real observations and factors (and even spontaneous impulse) to complicate and rebuild your vision into something lovelier.",Winter,"CHST 24191, CEGU 24191, ARTV 20205, GEOG 24191, ARTH 24191, AMER 24191, ENST 24191",,L.

ARCH 24199,The Life of Buildings. 100 Units.,"This course will examine the life of buildings-- how they perform, evolve, and adapt over time. How do particular design decisions influence human experience and behavior? Which parts of the building align with its intended use and what are surprising outcomes or changes? These questions aim to provide students with a deeper understanding of the built environment and the series of decisions that shaped them. Through readings, surveys, site visits, and conversations with architects and building users, we will measure and examine the spaces around us. Students will begin with a series of short analysis and design exercises and create short films, projective collages and diagrams, and architectural concept models. Building on our collective observations, research, and analysis, we will then finish with a final project where we respond to an existing building and propose an alternate life path.

ARCH 24220,Anxious Spaces. 100 Units.,"This course explores built (architectural), filmic, and narrative spaces that disturb our bearings, un-situate us, and defy neurotypical cognition. In the sense that ""angst"" is a mode that can be understood as both stalling and generative, we analyze spaces and representations of spaces such as corridors, attics, basements, canals, viaducts, labyrinths, forests, ruins, etc., spaces that are 'felt' as estranging, foreboding, in short, anxiety-provoking, in order to understand why-despite or because these topoi are hostile-they are produced, reproduced, and craved. We will pay special attention to abject spaces of racial and sexual exclusivity, sites of spoliation, and of memory and erasure. Among our primary texts are films by Kubrick, Tarkovksy, and Antonioni, and Chytilová, short fiction by Borges, Kafka, Nabokov, and selections from the philosophical/theoretical writings of Bachelard, Deleuze & Guattari, Debord, Foucault, Kracauer, and the edited volume, Mapping Desire, Geographies of Sexuality.",Winter,"GNSE 34220, GNSE 24220, REES 24220, REES 34220",,Malynne Sternstein
ARCH 24270,Children & Architecture. 100 Units.,"Many who pursue architecture do so initially out of a childlike fascination with buildings, places and worlds. Curiosity and limited understanding naturally provide children with an exploratory relationship to the built environments they traverse, and children also often show a heightened sense of wonder -- heightened emotions of all kinds -- as that relationship plays out. (This can be positive and formative, or scary and traumatic.) And yet, many of the adults who make choices about the worlds we inhabit think mostly of adults, and as adults, in doing so. This architecture studio course investigates the built world through a child's eyes, across different moments in history, including our own. Readings and seminar discussions will range from playgrounds to blocks, preschools to family relations, swimming pools and sandcastles to the very construction of childhood as an idea. We will explore Chicago, and meet with builders of all ages, likely culminating in designing (and potentially building) a real playground space.

ARCH 25402,Sound & Environment. 100 Units.,"Huge sections of the Earth's crust resonate across hundreds of miles: seismology, infrasound. Fish larvae differentiate tiny vibrations in ocean water produced by diverse coral ecosystems: hydroacoustics, ultrasound. Humans gather in large numbers to watch each other carefully manipulate air pressure: music, architecture, psychoacoustics. Each of these phenomena can be understood to fit within the field of sound studies, and each among many further examples has an effect upon each other, contributing to a delicately interlinked planetary system of pressure, vibration, and resonance within air, water, land, and body. This system is now in crisis. From the most densely populated cities to the remotest nature preserves and industrial hinterlands, the extraction, processing, transportation, and consumption of natural resources by humans interferes with delicate systems of sounding and listening essential to almost all forms of life on Earth. How can sound studies and audio technology help us navigate this moment? This course takes students through a survey of sound studies and audio technology, from physics, electronics, hearing, and psychoacoustics to the aesthetics, politics, and poetics of musical and non-musical sound production.

This course in landscape architecture explores the constructed environments around Chicago's varied and interconnected water systems along these material and immaterial lines. As a studio/seminar hybrid, this course comprises a series of studio projects, critical and literary readings, seminar discussions, creative writing, and explorations. Seminar and studio sessions will together track a progression from the interior - perceptions, memories, and felt experiences of water that animate landscape with personal meaning - to the exterior - specific landscapes around Chicago's water bodies and the social, political, and ecological forces at play between the city and these environments. The final studio project will examine a constructed landscape along an edge between land and water in Chicago. Students will map the history and ecology of the project site and use that as a jumping off point for its reimagination, negotiating between large-scale systemic forces and the peculiar details of that place.

ARCH 26005,Cities by Design. 100 Units.,"This course examines the theory and practice of city design-how, throughout history, people have sought to mold and shape cities in pre-determined ways. The form of the city is the result of myriad factors, but in this course we will hone in on the purposeful act of designing cities according to normative thinking-ideas about how cities ought to be. Using examples from all time periods and places around the globe, we will examine how cities are purposefully designed and what impact those designs have had. Where and when has city design been successful, and where has it resulted in more harm than good?",Winter,"PBPL 26005, GEOG 26005, ENST 26005",,Evan Carver
ARCH 26008,Historic Preservation Studio. 100 Units.,"This course is an introduction to the preservation of the built environment. What are the benefits of preserving historic resources? Students will conduct studies of historic buildings in Chicago, exploring their cultural significance and impact on neighborhoods, and applying preservation tools and methods to formulate policies to advance preservation goals. We will also debate preservation's role in addressing climate change and its role in advancing social goals, such as maintaining neighborhood diversity. Through readings, archival research, mapping, field visits, and interaction with professionals in the field, we will consider the possibilities of leveraging historic preservation to advance social, economic, and environmental goals.",Not offered in 2023-2024 academic year.,"CHST 26008, ENST 26008, GEOG 36008",,Emily Talen
ARCH 26075,South Asian Sensoriums. 100 Units.,"What is a 'sense'? How do we attune, coordinate, and interpret our senses and the information that we receive through them? How do we structure and shape the world around us for and through the senses? We will address these questions by diving into the multi-sensory worlds of South Asia-a region that includes the present states of India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Tibet, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka-and learning how peoples of the region have theorized and employed the senses to understand and shape their aesthetic, social, and religious worlds. We will taste spices, smell fragrances, listen to music and street sounds, 'visit' temples, mosques, and museums, read literary, philosophical, and religious texts, and view works of visual and sculptural art in order to better understand which aspects of sensory experience are indeed 'universal' and which are conditioned by history and culture.",Spring,"SIGN 26075, SALC 26075",,Tyler Williams

ARCH 26280,Site-Based Practice: Choreographing The Smart Museum. 100 Units.,"This course gives students the unique opportunity to create a collaborative, site-based work that culminates in a final performance at UChicago's Smart Museum of Art. Using embodied research methods that respond to site through moving, sensing, and listening, we'll explore the relationship between the ephemerality of movement and the materiality of bodies and place, and consider how the site-based contexts for dance shift how it is perceived, experienced, and valued. Our quarter-long creation process will begin with a tour of the Smart Museum, guided by curators and members of the Public Practice team, that will provide context to the museum's exhibitions, programming, and its relationship to geography and community. Assigned readings, viewings, and conversations with guest artists will delve into the relationship between dance and the sites where it happens, including museums-from the material relationship between bodies, objects, and architecture to the digital flows of choreography online.",Spring,"ARTV 30027, TAPS 36280, TAPS 26280, CHST 26280, ARTV 20027",,J.

ARCH 26322,"A History of Public Spaces in Mexico, 1520-2020. 100 Units.","Streets and plazas have been sites in which much of Mexican history has been fought, forged, and even performed. This course examines the history of public spaces in Mexico since the Spanish Conquest. By gauging the degree to which these sites were truly open to the public, it addresses questions of social exclusion, resistance, and adaptability. The course traces more than the role and evolution of built sites. It also considers the individuals and groups that helped to define these places. This allows us to read street vendors, prostitutes, students, rioters, and the ""prole"" as central historical actors. Through case studies and primary sources, we will examine palpable examples of how European colonization, various forms of state building, and more recent neoliberal reforms have transformed ordinary Mexicans and their public spaces.",Spring,"LACS 25322, HIST 26322, ENST 26322",,C.

ARCH 26511,Cities from Scratch: The History of Urban Latin America. 100 Units.,"Latin America is one of the world's most urbanized regions and its urban heritage long predates European conquest. Yet the region's urban experience has generally been understood through North Atlantic models, which often treat Latin American cities as disjunctive, distorted knockoffs of idealized US or European cities. This class interrogates and expands those North Atlantic visions by emphasizing the history of vital urban issues such as informality, inequality, intimacy, race, gender, violence, plural regulatory regimes, the urban environment, and rights to the city. Interdisciplinary course materials include anthropology, sociology, history, fiction, film, photography, and journalism produced from the late nineteenth to the early twenty-first centuries.",Winter,"HIST 36511, ENST 26511, HIST 26511, CEGU 26511, LACS 26510, LACS 36510","Some coursework in Latin American studies, urban studies, and/or history",B.

ARCH 26616,Tracing Time. 100 Units.,"Tracing Time is a hybrid seminar and studio. The first portion of the course will invite students to engage with a curated selection of techniques for representing time as a broad category of concerns, containing a wide range of nuanced conceptual frameworks and constructs: subjective time, objective time, proper time, coordinate time, sidereal time, emergent time, encoding time, relativistic time, time dilation, reaction time, spacetime, etc. The second portion of the course will invite students to develop their own models, visualizations, and representations of time or temporal phenomenon as a support for considering time as a factor of change in relation to their own research or interest in a particular concern or context, or where time is bound to physical, psychological, ecological, climatic, biological, geological, economic, historical, geographic, or other entangled processes. This course requires no preparation and is therefore open to students from any discipline who share a general interest in urban design, architecture and the arts or who specifically wish to develop a deeper understanding of drawings, models, photographs, video and other graphic mediums as material supports for inquiry.

ARCH 27155,Urban Design with Nature. 100 Units.,"This course will use the Chicago region as the setting to evaluate the social, environmental, and economic effects of alternative forms of human settlement. Students will examine the history, theory and practice of designing cities in sustainable ways - i.e., human settlements that are socially just, economically viable, and environmentally sound. Students will explore the literature on sustainable urban design from a variety of perspectives, and then focus on how sustainability theories play out in the Chicago region. How can Chicago's neighborhoods be designed to promote environmental, social, and economic sustainability goals? This course is part of the College Course Cluster program: Urban Design. In Winter 2025, Urban Design with Nature will focus on sustainable and accessible mobility with a focus on campus and the neighborhoods we transverse and inhabit. Students will consider how mobility is central to urban sustainability and how to reimagine cities, neighborhoods and campuses as social and economic spaces connected by safe, low impact, environmental, equitable and efficient networks of transit.

ARCH 27522,Experimental Futures: Re-figurations of Human/Environment Relationships. 100 Units.,"The naming of the current era after the human-Anthropocene-is widely criticized. Scholars such as Donna Haraway bemoan the emphasis on the human being and its control over earthly matters at a moment when non-human entanglements with the world are simultaneously overlooked. Other thinkers point out that the planetary changes of the Anthropocene have occurred mainly due to capitalism and industrialization. In the course of these debates, the role of the human and the understanding of the human as part of the Earth's ecosystem is discussed again and again. Especially in the arts and design, new figurations of the human and a future outside anthropocentrism are being developed. This course follows fundamental questions around the emergence of this discourse: Which tropes, materials, and concepts do we collectively use to imagine our future? Who gets to participate in these imaginaries and who is thereby excluded? What role do the arts and design play in this process? In this class, students will gain understanding of an emerging area of interdisciplinary research that reframes the category of the ""human"" in face of contemporary environmental challenges such as climate change and resource scarcity. Students will become familiar with concepts and theories associated with post-humanism, new materialisms, and environmental humanities and use them to reflect on examples from architecture, design, and the arts.",Winter,"CMST 37522, CMST 27522, MADD 27522",,Desiree Foerster

ARCH 28702,Introduction to GIS and Spatial Analysis. 100 Units.,"This course provides an introduction and overview of how spatial thinking is translated into specific methods to handle geographic information and the statistical analysis of such information. This is not a course to learn a specific GIS software program, but the goal is to learn how to think about spatial aspects of research questions, as they pertain to how the data are collected, organized and transformed, and how these spatial aspects affect statistical methods. The focus is on research questions relevant in the social sciences, which inspires the selection of the particular methods that are covered. Examples include spatial data integration (spatial join), transformations between different spatial scales (overlay), the computation of ""spatial"" variables (distance, buffer, shortest path), geovisualization, visual analytics, and the assessment of spatial autocorrelation (the lack of independence among spatial variables).

ARCH 28925,Health Impacts of Transportation Policies. 100 Units.,"Governments invest in transport infrastructure because it encourages economic growth and mobility of people and goods, which have direct and indirect benefits to health. Yet, an excessive reliance on motorized modes of transport harms population health, the environment, and social well-being. The impact on population health is substantial: Globally, road traffic crashes kill over 1.3 million annually. Air pollution, to which transport is an important contributor, kills another 3.2 million people. Motorized modes of transport are also an important contributor to sedentary lifestyles. Physical inactivity is estimated to cause 3.2 million deaths every year, globally. This course will introduce students to thinking about transportation as a technological system that affects human health and well-being through intended and unintended mechanisms. The course will examine the complex relationship between transportation, land use, urban form, and geography, and explore how decisions in other sectors affect transportation systems, and how these in turn affect human health. Students will learn to recognize how the system level properties of a range of transportation systems (such as limited-access highways, urban mass transit, inter-city rail) affect human health.",Spring,"HLTH 28925, CEGU 28925, PBPL 28925, ENST 28925",,"Bhalla, Kavi"
ARCH 29506,Home and Empire: From Little House on the Prairie to Refugee Camps. 100 Units.,"What can living rooms tell us about Empires? What did it mean to be a housewife in an imperial society? This course answers these and other questions by exploring the relationship between domesticity and imperialism over the past three hundred years. We will explore how Catholic Native Potawatomi women decorated their homes in the early 18th century, how black South African maids interacted with white employers during apartheid, and how young male refugees in contemporary France try to make homes in the land of their former colonial ruler. Through this work students will unpack the racial, gendered, spatial, and political logics of imperial rule. This course is organized around three thematic phases: conquest and expansion, rule and resistance, and decolonization. After introducing theoretical approaches to the study of domesticity and imperialism, we will use case studies from across the globe to work through these thematic groups. We will discuss cases from North America, the Caribbean, Asia, Africa, Oceania, and Europe. By combining secondary literature with films, memoirs, domestic objects, and visual sources we will evaluate the intersections of imperialism and home-life. Students will ultimately conduct a final research project on a topic of their choosing to explore this courses' themes in depth. Students will work to challenge notions of home as an idyllic or a historical space and see the power and struggles that took place within walls.",Winter,"HIST 29506, GNSE 23128, CRES 23128",,Greg Valdespino

ARCH 29634,African Cities and Urbanism. 100 Units.,"This course looks at urbanism and urbanization in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries through a focus on selected cities in East, Southern, and West Africa. Beginning with existing trade routes and economic centers onto which some colonial cities were mapped, the course explores waves of migration over different historical periods, infrastructural imaginaries and the policies that shaped them, informal and formal economies, and cultural expressions and representations of life and living in the city. We will draw from a diversity of sources including fiction, non-fiction, architecture, town planning, photography, and the arts to examine political, social, economic, and topographical features and forces that drove the growth and development of each city studied, and also to reflect on commonalities that emerged between cities across different regions of the continent.",,"HIST 29634, RDIN 29634, CEGU 29634",,

ARTH 14402,Introduction to the Arts of the Italian Renaissance. 100 Units.,"This course will cover the major themes and works of the Italian Renaissance, including painting, sculpture, decorative arts, and architecture. We will consider stylistic development of the arts from the period of roughly 1300 (late Medieval/pre-Renaissance predecessors) to 1560. Throughout the course we will interrogate the concept of ""Renaissance"" as a unifying term and examine its relationship to the Medieval in terms of both continuity and change. A major focus of the course will be the functions of different media in this time period, and we will consider patronage, multiple viewerships, and access. We will explore how, for whom, and why works were created, and interrogate the relevance of the category 'fine arts' as it is commonly understood to the Renaissance. Additional themes will be: artistic practice, especially collaboration and competition; regional styles; the relationship of art in this period to the intellectual, political, and spiritual climate(s) of the time.""",Summer,,,

These are some of the most iconic examples of Pop Art made in the United States. Since the 1960s, artists around the world have also explored art's relationship to mass media, consumerism, and representation. This course will examine the work of artists outside of the Euro-American canon who have employed Pop Art strategies. We will cover a wide geographic and temporal expanse, with a special focus on Latin America, and including as well art from East Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.",Spring,,,A. Obiols Roca
ARTH 14707,Meiji Modern: Reassessing Common Narratives of Japanese Art. 100 Units.,"This course is taught in tandem with the traveling exhibition ""Meiji Modern: Fifty Years of New Japan,"" shown at The David and Alfred Smart Museum of Art, open from March 21st, 2024, to June 9th, 2024. Through the exhibition and its objects, the course will contemplate and question the canonization of Meiji art (and the common narratives of art that are engrained in one's mind). The main pedagogical approach used in this course is visual analysis. Students are required to visit the museum and interact with the actual objects, which will help solidify abstract concepts of Meiji artworks learned in class. While this course is not intended to survey Japanese art history, it aims to equip students with skills that will enable them to ask art-historical questions. Students majoring in art history may also benefit from taking this course, as it is an excellent opportunity to understand what one misses when one cannot access physical artwork.",Spring,,,M.

ARTH 15401,The Matter of Medium: Contexts and Making of Medieval Art. 100 Units.,"Social media, TV, and print are today's most popular formats for the consumption of images, but what visual media were available to medieval viewers and how did they influence beliefs and practices? This course introduces the art of medieval Europe, covering the period from the Fall of the Roman Empire to the eve of the Reformation (c. 500-1500), a period rich in technological innovation. Why does medium matter? What counts as medieval media? We will examine a range of visual material, both luxury and mass produced, including manuscript illuminations, relics, pilgrimage souvenirs, paintings, prints, and the human body. Students will become familiar with major themes in the study of the art of the Middle Ages, such as the relationship between word and image, the role of the artist, socio-economic structures of art production, and changing attitudes toward the image. We will also track the afterlives of medieval objects by looking at their re-use and re-interpretation across time through collecting, curation, and conservation-restoration. Hands-on experiments with art materials and visits to local collections will build knowledge of the physicality of objects. By the end of the course, students will be able to recognize key medieval artworks and monuments, analyze visual material, and distinguish some historical materials and techniques of production. Assignments are tied to building confidence in visual literacy, critical thinking, and oral presentation.",Winter,,,C. Tom
ARTH 15630,Introduction to South Asian Art: Part I. 100 Units.,"This core class introduces students to the visual arts of early, ancient, and early medieval South Asia. In this massive time period, South Asia gave birth to three major world religions-Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism. Christianity and Islam too made it to South Asia and the arts of these religious traditions flourished in various pockets of the Indian subcontinent. In the class, we will look at objects, buildings, and things that continue to beguile researchers, such as the paintings of Bhimbetka Caves (10,000 BCE); the enigmatic seals from Indus Valley (ca. 2000 BCE); the high polish of Mauryan sculptures, like the Ashokan capital that forms the emblem of India (ca. 3rd cent. BCE); the extraordinary rock-cut temples of Ajanta and Ellora (fifth to thirteenth centuries); and the famous minarets of Jam and Qutb in Afghanistan and Delhi (twelfth century). While the course will explore many themes, some prominent ones will be the role of politics, nature, and religion in shaping artistic practices. Conversely, we will also look at how artistic practices impacted the experience and understanding of state formation, natural resources, and religious practices.",Winter,SALC 15630,,M. Manohar
ARTH 15635,Introduction to South Asian Art: Part II. 100 Units.,"This core class will pick up the narrative thread from Introduction to South Asian Art: Part I, although taking Part I is not a pre-requisite (but encouraged). We will cover the period of South Asian art from the fourteenth century until the present day. During the period covered in this class, European explorers landed on Indian coasts, with the Portuguese making it to India as early as 1498. (Christopher Columbus tried to get to India too, but as is well known, he got massively lost.) From the fifteenth century, with European forays into the Americas, the world order changed dramatically, and South Asia-and its artistic culture-benefited from being a commercial hub. South Asian patrons commissioned such extraordinarily expensive buildings and objects as the Taj Mahal (completed 1653) and the Peacock Throne (1635; the Kohinoor diamond from this throne forms the centerpiece of the British crown jewels). Equally, climate crises and colonial exploitation from as early as the seventeenth century left its marks in the art of the region. The modern period saw anticolonial resistance, the emergence of postcolonial nation states, as well as the dispersal of a vast South Asian diasporic community across the world. Art making and architectural practice responded to each of these historical shifts, and this class will examine what the visual art from South Asia can teach us about its complex history from the late medieval period up to the present day.",Spring,SALC 15635,,M.

ARTH 16107,"Moving Objects, Dispersed Cultures: Case Studies from China and the Middle East. 100 Units.","In this course, we will delve into ""big problems"" created by the movement, relocation, or displacement of objects that are assigned special cultural, artistic, and historical values in new contexts. We will follow the movement of artifacts across both geographical and disciplinary boundaries, challenging established notions of cultural heritage and art. We often study and read ancient texts as primary sources, but we don't always pause to consider that those texts were written on physical objects like pieces of wood, leaves, or animal skin. Similarly, we're familiar with the display of ancient artwork inside museums or galleries, but have we wondered about the journey of individual objects to those new locations? How do objects move from their original place to modern collections? How do they become art? And how do they become historical sources? Guided by an art historian and a social historian, this course presents different ways to look at ""objects that move"", both as sources about past societies and as mirrors for contemporary ones. Through studying examples from the history of China and the Middle East, we will reconsider concepts such as cultural heritage, national patrimony, or even art that have been taken for granted. We will learn about the different histories of the dispersal of cultural heritages in those two regions, from nation-building and colonial projects in the twentieth century to the illicit trade in antiquities and the creation of digital replicas today.",Winter,"RLST 26107, NEHC 16107, EALC 36107, ARTH 36107, BPRO 27100, NEHC 36107, EALC 16107",PQ: Third or fourth-year standing.,"Wei-Cheng Lin, Cecilia Palombo"

ARTH 17121,The Art of Leonardo da Vinci. 100 Units.,"The central focus of this course will be on the small, damaged and disputed body of paintings that Leonardo has left to us, the wealth of his drawings that help us make sense of that problematic heritage and provide the most direct route into his creative thinking, and the hundreds of pages of text in the form of notes in mirror-image handwriting that comment on art and so many other subjects. Our structure will be roughly chronological, including his late fifteenth-century Florentine artistic and social context; his two long periods in Milan as a court artist; his triumphant return to Florence and rivalry with the young Michelangelo; his brief and unsatisfying stay in papal Rome; and his final years in France. Among the themes that will be critically examined are: Leonardo's role in the creation of what is still grandiosely called the High Renaissance; the value and problematic aspects of thinking of him as the quintessential artist-scientist; the significance of the fact that he has been a figure of such obsessive art-historical and broader cultural significance for over 500 years; and the ways in which recent scientific examination and digital imaging have shed surprising amounts of new light on his art. Through the concentrated study of the works of Leonardo and his artistic context, the course will take seriously the attempt to introduce students with little or no background in art history to some of the major avenues for analysis and interpretation in this field.",Autumn,FNDL 21414,Students must attend first class to confirm enrollment.

This course will provide an overview of French art in this period. Three themes will predominate: the rise of philosophical skepticism (pyrrhonisme) and the New Science, and their impact on ideas of painting; the relationship between new ""practices of the self"" and practices of knowledge; and political centralization and the emergence of the police state. We will discuss major artists like Nicolas Poussin, Philippe de Champaigne, Georges de la Tour, Claude Lorraine, and Charles Le Brun, as well as lesser-known figures like Laurent de la Hyre, Lubin Baugin, Eustache Le Sueur, and Valentin de Boulogne.

ARTH 17307,Death and Dying in the Middle Ages. 100 Units.,"This course will explore the relationship between the visual arts and culture of death in the western Middle Ages. Death did not mark a firm end for medieval people, whose daily lives included ideas about the Resurrection, revenants, and saints - a special class of holy undead. We will turn to the visual arts as a privileged medium for commemorating and caring for the dead in order to chart changing conceptions of death and the afterlife from roughly the third century to 1500 CE. We will study a variety of works of art, from manuscripts to sculptures, textiles to poems, drawn from different regions throughout medieval Europe. Examining primary sources (in translation) and relevant secondary literature, students will hone their abilities to comprehend the past through historical objects and to understand the particular role that works of art played in mediating the relationships between the living and the dead. Special topics include reliquaries, necromancy, the Apocalypse, and the Black Death",Spring,,,T. Golan
ARTH 17412,U.S. LatinX Art. 100 Units.,"This course explores the history of artistic production of Latin American diasporic communities living in the U.S. over the course of the twentieth century and up to our present. How have Latinx artists advanced, challenged, and/or undermined the development of U.S.-American art? How did Latinx artists in the U.S. operate both in dialogue with and independently from artists working in Latin America? Where did the agendas of Latin American expatriates and exiles, immigrants, and U.S. nationals of Latin American heritage intersect and where did they diverge? Exploring a wide range of artistic mediums (painting, sculpture, photography, printmaking, murals, performance, installation, video) we will trace a history of modern and contemporary art through the work of artists whose heritage spans diverse Latinx cultures, including but not limited to: Chicanx, Nuyorican, Afro-Latinx, and Cuban-American. We will consider the ways that art helps us to unpack and push against the notion of Latinx identity and how it helps us tell a story of Latinx culture and experience in the U.S.",Winter,,,M.

In the first week, we study Islamic rock crystals and oliphants that were once in medieval French treasuries, and visit the Basilica of Saint Denis. In the second, we study Islamic ceramics, textiles, and works on paper that inspired French designers and painters, and visit the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon. Finally, we study select works that have recently been exhibited for the explicit purpose of cultural ambassadorship, and visit l'Institut du Monde Arabe.

ARTH 18706,Experiencing Medieval Art. 100 Units.,"How did medieval artists and audiences encounter their material world? How do we experience medieval art and architecture today? Students in this introductory survey course will learn how to describe, analyze, and contextualize landmarks of art and architecture from Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages (ca. 200-1200) over a broad geographical area, from the Steppe to the Atlantic and the Mediterranean to the British Isles. We will practice fundamental art-historical skills through a combination of practicum sessions, lectures, and discussion of assigned readings. In practicum sessions, we will interact with materials such as incense, parchment and papyrus from the Joel Snyder Materials Collection; view pilgrimage tokens in the Smart Museum Study Room; handle manuscripts in the Special Collections Research Center; and visit the neo-Gothic Rockefeller Memorial Chapel. Proceeding chronologically, we will focus on key themes including sacred space and ritual, image theory and iconoclasm, and the sociopolitical uses of art and architecture. In addition to participation, evaluation will be based on the submission of two annotated readings, a formal analysis assignment, a midterm, and a final exam.

ARTH 20033,Iconology East and West. 100 Units.,"Iconology is the study of images across media and cultures. It is also associated with philosophical reflections on the nature of images and their relation to language-the interplay between the ""icon"" and the ""logos."" A plausible translation of this compound word into Chinese would describe it as ""Words in Pictures, Pictures in Words"": 诗中有画，画中有诗. This seminar will explore the relations of word and image in poetics, semiotics, and aesthetics with a particular emphasis on how texts and pictures have been understood in the Anglo-European-American and Chinese theoretical traditions. The interplay of painting and poetry, speech and spectacle, audition and vision will be considered across a variety of media, particularly the textual and graphic arts. The aims of the course will be 1) to critique the simplistic oppositions between ""East"" and ""West"" that have bedevilled intercultural and intermedial comparative studies; 2) to identify common principles, zones of interaction and translation that make this a vital area of study.

How has photography helped to shape these practices, which have been central to the development of both art and science? How might an interdisciplinary approach to the medium of photography invigorate questions of form, abstraction, realism, and subjectivity? This seminar surveys key episodes in the history and theory of photographic media to uncover overlaps, parallels, and moments of exchange across the history of modern art and science. Course readings, presentations, and site visits will offer case studies with which to consider cross-disciplinary connections, from H. Becquerel's visualizations of radioactivity and E. J. Marey's chronophotographs charting bodies in motion, to scientific iconography appearing in the photograms of Man Ray and L. Moholy-Nagy or R. Rauschenberg's use of x-ray imagery.

We will investigate the aesthetic, material, and epistemological aspects of print, focusing on key moments in its development, such as Gutenberg's moveable type and Martin Luther's printed Bible, while also examining the works of artists like Martin Schongauer, Albrecht Dürer, and Marcantonio Raimondi. Particular emphasis will be placed on how printmaking not only revolutionized the dissemination of information and ideas but also redefined the boundaries of art in early modern Europe, thereby expanding the horizons of artistic expression. Students will learn essential concepts and techniques of printmaking and will explore a variety of theoretical and thematic issues related to its study, including notions of reproducibility, questions of authenticity, the advent of copyright law, artistic self-fashioning, evolving devotional practices, and the intersections of art and science.",Spring,ARTH 31206,,T.

ARTH 21426,Marx's Theory of Class. 100 Units.,"The topic of this course is Karl Marx's theory of socio-economic class. Its purpose is to gain insight into Marx's fundamental thesis that understanding classes helps us understand politics. Though it is one of the topics for which his name is most remembered, his view of class is often misrepresented. For instance, one might hear that, for Marx, there are just the two most famous classes of capitalist society-the so-called proletariat (workers) and the bourgeoisie (capitalists). Like classical economists before him and heterodox economists after him, however, Marx actually believes that modern societies consist of at least three classes: workers, capitalists, and landlords or rentiers, as well as other marginalized groups. And he even disaggregates those classes into the smaller groups which constitute them (e.g., productive and unproductive labor; industrial, commercial, and financial capital, etc.). By examining selections from his mature political-economic writings, we will reconstruct Marx's theory of social classes and consider his application of that theory in significant case studies such as the American Civil War. Themes which we will address include the relation between economy and politics, class and race, science and ideology, as well as agency and structure in historical development. Questions which we will ask include the advantages and disadvantages of Marx's view with an eye to contemporary questions.",,,,
ARTH 21451,Rhoades Seminar: Reading Ancient Egyptian Art. 100 Units.,"For millennia ancient Egyptian artists constructed visual narratives on tomb chapel walls, temple structures, and other material remains - such as stelae - that provide glimpses of lived experiences in the land that gave rise to this ancient African culture. Focusing on two-dimensional representations produced in Egypt (ancient Kemet) between approximately 3000-1069 BCE, this course will consider the functions of such pictorial accounts within their original contexts and explore approaches to reading and interpreting them. We will investigate topics including depictions of ""daily life"" on the Nile, royal sojourns to foreign lands, and the imagined landscapes of the underworld, deconstructing scenes and the ancient artistic conventions used to produce them. Particular emphasis will be placed on how the natural environment of North Africa is reflected in the arts of ancient Egypt, from detailed renderings of indigenous flora and fauna to interpretations of the physical landscape.

ARTH 21809,"Art at the Frontiers of Faith: Christians, Muslims, and Jews in Medieval Iberia. 100 Units.","Spain has long been marked out as a special case in medieval art history: a geographically and culturally distinct area in which the lives, material culture, and artistic practices of Muslims, Christians, and Jews were more closely intertwined than in any other part of the medieval world. This seminar proposes to test this deep-rooted vision of Spain's cultural hybridity, tracing through the study of its visual culture histories of cross-confessional contact, collaboration, and conflict. To account for local particularities and historical contingencies, the course follows a broadly chronological framework beginning with the construction of the Great Mosque of Córdoba after the Arab-Berber conquests of 711 and ending with the erection of Granada Cathedral in the aftermath of the expulsions and forced conversions of 1492. Over the quarter, we will critically analyze questions of religious and regional identity, paying close attention to how modern concerns have shaped scholarly approaches to this material. We will also take advantage of Chicago's collections of medieval Spanish art, notably those at the Art Institute and Newberry Library. This course welcomes students from different disciplines and caters especially to anyone interested in exploring questions related to the historical construction of identity and difference, the complexities of intercultural exchange, the modern reception of the Middle Ages, and the role of art in representing and shaping experience.",Autumn,,,B.

ARTH 21821,(Re-)Living Nazi Germany through the Eyes of the Graphic Novel. 100 Units.,"This course considers the graphic novel as an aesthetic and political response to Nazi Germany and the Holocaust. Through close reading of three paradigmatic graphic novels by German and American artists from WWII to the present day, we will develop a critical vocabulary to analyze the intermedial form and explore the historical conditions out of which these cultural artefacts emerge. Our journey begins with Charlotte Salomon's pioneering masterpiece Life? Or Theater? (1941-943), a recently discovered autobiographical account of life in the Third Reich created by the visionary German-Jewish artist before her death at Auschwitz at the age of 26. One generation later, Art Spiegelman, the son of a Holocaust survivor, produces his seminal 1980 graphic narrative Maus based on interviews with his father. In Nora Krug's 2018 graphic novel Belonging, the author seeks to understand her grandparents' potential collusion with the forces of ethnic cleansing in Nazi Germany. Our interpretative readings will focus on the authors' engagement with questions of European and Jewish identity and their treatment of historical trauma and culpability in the graphic novel form. This course is designed both for German majors/minors and majors from other disciplines. All texts are available in translation and class will be held in English. German majors are invited to engage directly with the German-language editions and historical sources. Additional discussions in German will be offered bi-weekly",Winter,GRMN 21821,,Emily Dreyfus

ARTH 22120,Ecocritical Art History: Perspectives from South Asia. 100 Units.,"How can art history contribute to the ongoing discourse about environmentalism? What can the study of art tell us about the interrelatedness of human creativity and the environment? In this seminar, we will wrestle with these questions through an ecocritical study of South Asian art. Ecocriticism has its origins in literary studies, although it is now an interdisciplinary field of study that explores how the natural world is portrayed in the arts, broadly conceived. Art history has long been interested in analyzing how artists depicted the natural world. However, such explorations have usually been framed by a narrow set of discreet concerns that have their origins in Enlightenment-era discourse; for example, landscape studies, animal studies (zoology), plant studies (botany), etc. Ecocriticism does not have any such limiting framework. An ecocritical study attempts to move beyond the irreducibly anthropocentric approach in the humanities to understand the natural environments in which humans made art. South Asian art is fundamentally marked by an interest in nature. The towers of Indian temples were conceived of as physical manifestations of the Himalayas. The door guardians that stand on either side of temple entrances are anthropomorphic depictions of the rivers Ganga and Yamuna.",Winter,ARTH 32120,,M. Manohar
ARTH 22305,Spiritual and Protective Lives of Objects in African Art. 100 Units.,"This seminar explores visual culture and historical arts of Africa primarily from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It is not an exhaustive geographical and temporal survey of the continent's object-making traditions, but rather, an introduction through a number of case studies highlighting religious practices and uses for art and objects of devotion and everyday life. Investigations will consider objects' tangible and intangible elements to examine their spiritual and protective dimensions through various lenses: organized religions, including Islam and Christianity, local belief systems and ritual practices, social or political organizations, and other cultural distinctions. Such contextualization will contribute to students' recognition of the diversity and historical depth of the continent's arts and cultures.

Students will engage with different artists, from Giotto to Raphael and Pellegrino Tibaldi, and different cultural and geographic contexts, from Padua and Bologna to Florence, Venice, and Rome, over the span of about three centuries.Students will explore a wide range of visual examples and textual sources on various subject matters, from poetry to history, from the Bible to vernacular accounts about saints, from mythology to contemporary chronicles, in order to investigate what kind of stories were told on the walls of halls and courts of honor, private rooms, or public spaces, aiming at understanding why each of them was chosen. Complex projects such as narrative mural and ceiling paintings usually involved a tight collaboration among artists, patrons, and iconographic consultants, all figures with whom students will become familiar. We will also analyse the theory behind the comparison of poetry and painting (""ut pictura poesis"", ""as is painting so is poetry"") by investigating the meaning and the reception of this ancient concept in early modern times, and its implications on the social role of the artist. Students will investigate the significance of narrative frescos in early modern times, while also asking questions about their value and impact today.",Winter,"ITAL 32888, ARTH 32816, ITAL 22888",,F.

At the same time, however, new ideas about human rights, cultural heritage, and international law began to reshape the place of looting in the exercise of power. This course will take up the history of looting in European cultural and political life from the late eighteenth through the twentieth centuries as a tool of nationalism, imperialism, totalitarianism, and scholarship. How was looting defined, who defined it, and what kinds of ethical and legal codes governed its use? How was the seizure of personal property, cultural artifacts, and sacred objects legitimized by its practitioners and experienced by its victims? In what ways did looting change the meaning of objects and why? How do we understand looting in relationship to other forms of violence and destruction in the modern period? While the focus of the course will be on Europe, we will necessarily be concerned with a global frame as we follow cases of looting in colonial contexts, through migration, exploration, and during war.

Student in this class will learn about Mitchell's life and work through the close study of her paintings and works on paper, gaining a foundation in the methods of object-based learning and applied art historical research of the sort practiced in museums. Together, we will survey the state of the scholarly field on Mitchell and conduct a critical review of her literature and recent exhibitions. We will also consider Mitchell's early upbringing in Chicago-her exposure to works on view at the Art Institute during her teenage years, her training at the School of the Art Institute and Ox-Bow School of Art, her immersion in the activities of the Poetry Foundation-and interrogate where and how these experiences may and may not be germane to an understanding of her work.

How do spatial or object-driven arguments differ from textual ones? This course pursues such questions through a series of case studies focusing on exhibitions of modern and contemporary art. Structured around the richness of Chicago's art collections and spaces, each class session will bring us to a different institution, including on-campus venues like the Smart Museum of Art and the Renaissance Society, and off-campus ones, including the Arts Club of Chicago, the Driehaus Museum, and the Art Institute of Chicago. Over the course of the quarter, we will develop a toolkit for analyzing a variety of modes of exhibiting art, touching on a range of spaces and topics, including the emergence of the modern museum of the 1930s, the role of artists and institutional critique, approaches to exhibiting global contemporary art, and the place of performance in the museum. In each case, we will consider the ways that curators put artworks in conversation with one another spatially, advancing individual or institutional points of view, and explore how such strategies differ according to subject matter and context of display. This seminar is offered as part of the Chicago Objects Study Initiative.

ARTH 23815,"COSI: The Material, Visual and Social Lives of Things from Premodern China. 100 Units.","Artifacts from pre-modern China are often on display in museums today as art objects, and appreciated for their aesthetic value and craftsmanship. However, before entering modern collection, many of them had participated in people's daily, cultural, religious, and/or social lives. They were used, touched, collected and exchanged; they also inspired and mediated intimate emotions, philosophical discussions and artistic creations. In this course, we will study an array of objects of this sort, from bronze vessels and mirrors, to porcelains and textiles. Taking cues from their material and visual aspects, we will examine a selection of objects within their original contexts where they were made and used, and think about how they would have engaged their historical beholders. We will also explore the objects' ""journeys"" across time, space and medium, and discuss the theoretical and ethical issues that arise from each scenario. Through lectures, in-class discussions, museum visits, readings and writing assignments, students will familiarize themselves with the cultures of pre-modern China through the objects it produced, and develop skills of visual thinking and material-based analysis of art objects.

ARTH 24045,Painting Landscapes in 19th century France. 100 Units.,"Over the course of the 19th century in France, landscape emerged as a preeminent genre for exploring the complexities of the modern world. The massive growth of cities, industry, tourism, and other environmental changes dramatically affected inherited notions of ecological balance. How did landscape painters respond to these challenges by developing new aesthetic attitudes and representational strategies? We'll study how landscapes evolved from the Romantics and the Barbizon school, through the Realists at mid-century, to the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists. Artists to be considered in depth include Théodore Rousseau, Gustave Courbet, Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, Paul Cézanne, Georges Seurat, and Vincent van Gogh.

ARTH 24200,Migratory Aesthetics. 100 Units.,"What could it meant to construct a migratory history of modern art and design? The nineteenth century has been characterized by bounded models of settlement, citizenship, subjectivity, and what it might look like to intimately belong in such a world. Yet the character of that belonging was entangled with experiences of mass migration, mobility, displacement, exile, and untiring attempts to imagine a world otherwise. In this seminar, we will recenter migration as a material reality and interpretive tool. Through a series of case studies grounded in Europe and its wider worlds, students will investigate moments in which people, objects, and ideas formed as a result of the utterly mobile nature of nineteenth-century life and expressive thought. We will turn our attention to a wave of recent scholarship on the topic, and to literary and critical writings of the period, alongside paintings, prints, sculpture, design, and built environments (many from local collections). In short, frequent writing assignments, students will be prompted to reflect on broader applications of a migratory method for reading familiar objects and histories anew.",Spring,ARTH 34200,Consent Only,Alex Fraser

The study of illustration has, however, emerged as a new interdisciplinary field in recent years, though illustration has often been neglected as an ornamental ""handmaiden"" to the printed word or as a commercial appendage to the book. This seminar will approach the topic with a focus on the heyday of the illustrated book, the nineteenth century, from the perspectives of book history, literary criticism, art history, word and image studies, and translation and adaptation studies. Topics to be considered to include: paratextuality; illustration as translation and/or adaptation; extra-illustration; illustration and authorship; text-image interactions or non-interactions; illustration and mass production; photography and illustration.",Autumn,"ARTH 34524, GRMN 34524, GRMN 24524",,Catriona Macleod
ARTH 24815,Collecting the Ancient World: Museum Practice and Politics. 100 Units.,"Where is this artifact from? Who does it belong to? How did it get here? Who's telling its story? Critical inquiry into the practice and politics of museums has reached a new zenith in contemporary discourse. From discussions of acquisition and repatriation to provenience (archaeological findspot) and provenance (an object's ownership history) and the ethics of curation and modes of display, museum and art professionals-and the general public alike-are deliberating on the concept of museums and the responsibilities of such institutions towards the collections in their care. This course will explore the early history of museums and collecting practices and their impact on the field today, with a focus on cultural heritage collections from West Asia and North Africa. We will first spend time on such topics as archaeological exploration of ""the Orient,"" colonial collecting practices, and the antiquities trade, as well as the politics of representation and reception in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Next, we will look at critical issues presently facing museums, including ethical collection stewardship, provenance research, repatriation, community engagement, and public education. The course will be structured in a seminar format, with lectures devoted to the presentation of key themes by the instructor and critical discussion as a group. Meetings will include visits to the ISAC Museum at UChicago.",Winter,"NEHC 34815, HIST 30509, ARTH 34815, NEHC 24815, HIST 20509",,K. Neumann
ARTH 24816,Museums Today. 100 Units.,"Through a series of case studies, this course examines how museums are radically rethinking their function, their audiences, and their practices. What problems do they seek to redress? Who do the solutions aim to serve, and to what end? This course ultimately asks students to debate the role of the museum in the 21st century by way of course readings drawn from theory, scholarship, and the popular press; class discussions complimented by visits from guest scholars, artists, and curators; and engagement with real and virtual museum spaces.",Winter,ARTH 34816,,M.

ARTH 24910,INSECT MEDIA. 100 Units.,"How have insects affected ways of knowing and relating to the world? This course opens a dialogue between insects and Japanese audiovisual cultures, including fiction, poetry, visual art, manga, anime, and film. We aim to address the important and profound challenge that recent trends in animal studies, environmental humanities, and eco-criticism pose to received ways of studying human cultures and societies. The challenge lies in offering alternatives to the entrenched reliance on a nature-culture divide, which gives culture explanatory preference over nature. In the case of Japan and insects, for instance, there exists a fairly significant body of scholarship on how Japanese people respond to, interact with, and represent insects, and yet priority is generally given to culture, and Japan is treated monolithically. To offer alternatives to this monolithic culturalism, in this course we will (a) open dialogue between culture accounts of insects and scientific accounts and (b) explore different forms of media offering different milieus where human animals and more-than-human insects come into relation without assuming the ascendency of one over the other.",Autumn,"CDIN 34910, ARTH 34910, CMST 34915, CMST 24910, EALC 34910, CDIN 24910",Consent of Instructor required: interested students should submit one paragraph of interest to Professors Foxwell and Lamarre.,Chelsea Foxwell and Thomas Lamarre

ARTH 25140,Aesthetic Ecologies. 100 Units.,"What would an intellectual history of the environment look like when told from the perspective of art history writing? The geographer Friedrich Ratzel, who first began using the term ""Umwelt"" (""environment"") in a systematic way, claimed that, up to the end of the 19th century, the idea of environment had been primarily discussed not in scientific contexts but rather in aesthetic ones, by ""artistically predisposed thinkers."" In this course, we will take Ratzel's claim seriously and aim to recuperate the aesthetic side of theories of environment across diverse areas such as: notions of landscape (""the picturesque""); aesthetic and biological theories of milieu (Haeckel's ""ecology,"" Taine's ""milieu,"" Uexküll's ""Umweltlehre""); Warburg's cultural history; the ""sculpture of environment"" (Rodin and Rilke); the ""space-body"" in modern dance (Laban). This course is about artworks that continue beyond their material confines into the space environing them. It focuses on evocations of air as the material space surrounding an artwork in texts that thematize the continuity between artwork as image and material object. Materials include: Aby Warburg, Rudolf Laban, Siegfried Ebeling, Camillo Sitte, Otto Wagner, Alois Riegl, R.M. Rilke, Wassily Kandinsky, Martin Heidegger, and others.

ARTH 25202,The Global Renaissance. 100 Units.,"This course examines the early modern period (1450-1800) through the study of objects produced in various parts of the world that circulated the globe. Some case studies will include: the printed image, feather painting, the biombo, the automaton, porcelain, the atlas, and stonework. Some of these goods were novel, some were hybrid in medium and construction, and many were made in multiples or as copies. How did they circulate? Why were they made and how did they function? Recent publications on such objects and about the ""global Renaissance"" more broadly will be paired with primary source analysis of inventories, letters, and travel writing from the early modern period in order to evaluate this complex period of cross-cultural interaction and innovation in artistic production and collection. The class will visit the Art Institute of Chicago, the Newberry Library, and the Adler Planetarium for close study of materials in their current museum or library spaces.",Spring,ARTH 35202,,L.

ARTH 25402,The Invisible within Visual Art. 100 Units.,"What the work of art looks like isn't too important."" This is what U.S.-American artist Sol Lewitt wrote about conceptual art in 1967. This course takes Lewitt's statement seriously, asking: how can we consider the non-visible dimensions of artworks? How do we interpret artworks that rely upon extra-visual material, including other sensory material like touch, taste, sound, and smell, but also ideas? How do aspects that the viewer must imagine impact the way that artworks make meaning? Taking a broad approach to the category of conceptual art, this course will explore the history of art that is rooted in ideas from the 1910s to the present, investigating case studies of conceptual works from around the globe. Considering artworks that take a wide variety of forms, from paintings and sculptures, to documentary photographs and faked documentary photographs, to performances, installations, and participatory invitations, we will test Lewitt's statement. If what a given artwork looks like isn't all that important, how might the invisible inform our understanding of that artwork instead?",Autumn,ARTH 35402,,
ARTH 25545,Cartography & the Early Modern State. 100 Units.,"This seminar focuses on concurrent watersheds in drawing, cartography, and information technology - the rise of hand-drawn maps in government archives. This occurred in fifteenth-century Venice, the first state to combine surveying, drawing, and text in the systematic collection, storage, delivery, and analysis of geospatial data concerning its territories. A radical departure from classical and medieval cartography, Venice's paper maps synced perspectival pictures with nested layers of toponyms, informational legends, directional indicators and scale bars, requiring a new kind of literacy and hardware to calculate distance. No precedent existed for this analog GIS (geographic information system); other chancery collections came later or did not have the same functionality. We will compare Venice's paper maps to contemporary landscape painting and print culture's bird's eye views and maps. We will address their increasingly dynamic interface, methods of indexing, and storage and retrieval before the arrival of filing cabinets; the addition of polychrome reliefs with their heightened sense of being there; and the increase in flattening abstractions through the end of the Venetian empire (1797). These abstractions anticipated modern mapping before the advent of digital GIS (also a government initiative) and cartography's return to embedding the user. Students are welcome from across the disciplines and may choose related topics for supervised research projects.",Winter,ARTH 35545,,K. Barzman
ARTH 25711,Exhibiting Photographs. 100 Units.,"This course traces the history of photography through a progression of landmark exhibitions, exploring the ongoing and reciprocal relationship between theories of photography and modes of public display. From the first public demonstrations of the new invention(s) through the emergence of photographic salons in the late nineteenth century, the forms of early exhibitions mirrored photography's fluid and indeterminate cultural status. By the interwar period, new theories of display and visual communication developed by the European and American avant-garde helped to elevate photography's standing in museums, transforming its liminal position between art and mass culture into a modernist virtue. For each case study, students will assess the ways that photographic exhibitions embody cultural and aesthetic values, political ideologies, shifts within the art market, and underlying ideas about photography itself. Along with these historical investigations, the course will include several visits to a multisite exhibition of contemporary photography to engage with current issues tied to curating and display.",Spring,ARTH 35711,,C.

We will investigate the uses of photography in shaping, documenting, and disseminating narratives surrounding ecological crises, activism, and public policy. Through a survey of photographic works in a variety of formats and media, we will explore how visual culture has shaped ecological thought and international politics over the last half-century, starting with the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. Adopting an interdisciplinary human-centered framework, this course foregrounds questions of environmental justice, sustainability, and the impacts of colonialism on landscapes and communities, offering insight into the role of photographic media as a catalyst for societal change.",Spring,ARTH 35712,,C.

ARTH 25731,Gender Before Gender: Constructing Bodies in Ancient American Art. 100 Units.,"In this course, we will seek to test the possibilities and limits of understanding gender and sex in premodernity through an inquiry into the artistic traditions of the ancient Americas. Works of art constitute a primary means by which we can access ideas about what we call gender and sex. Based on what we can reconstruct from visual, textual, and archaeological sources, these cultures conceptualized and represented gender in ways that might seem unfamiliar, in the process putting into question our own preconceptions. Indeed, pre-modern works of art might not have served to simply record conventions of gender but also helped construct the very idea of a sexed body within a given cultural context. As we discover commonalities and divergences between these Indigenous American traditions, we will learn to think across cultural contexts and disciplinary divides, putting into question some of our own assumptions. We will see that gender is not an immutable construct but something actively brought into being in different ways in different times and places.",Spring,"ARTH 35731, GNSE 30138, LACS 35731, LACS 25731, GNSE 20138",Consent of instructor required; email Professor Brittenham a paragraph-long description about what you bring and what you hope to get out of this seminar.,C.

ARTH 26001,Religion and Visual Culture in the Late Antique Mediterranean. 100 Units.,"In this seminar, we examine sacred sites and artifacts of early Christians and their neighbors in the regions around the Mediterranean from the third century to about 750 CE. Case studies will illustrate the wealth of religious art and architecture associated with different religions that existed side by side-Christianity, Judaism, polytheism, and emerging Islam. This course has five main objectives: (1) to examine how the designs of religious spaces, buildings, and objects respond to specific spiritual or ritualistic needs; (2) to gain familiarity with typical features characterizing the arts of each religion or sect; (3) to identify elements of a common visual language that result from shared traditions or artistic cross-pollination; (4) to examine different ways in which material artifacts were employed as means of ideological propaganda; and (5) to study art and architecture as evidence of doctrinal competition and conflict.

Why-and how-do we do it? Does an education in the arts and letters make us more moral, more intelligent, more resistant to authority-or perhaps more submissive? These questions are at the center of debates about the place of cultural learning in the contemporary world, but our century was not the first to think critically about the social and political functions of this form of education. This course investigates how students, educators, writers, and artists conceptualized the aims and means of becoming cultured from the 1700s forward, focusing on European history and connecting it to the concerns of the present. We will pay particularly close attention to both formal and informal means of cultural education, and to the ways in which these practices have been understood to produce social structures of class, gender, and race. Readings will draw from the fields of history, literature, philosophy, sociology, and art history. At the end of the quarter, students will be asked to design their own fantasy syllabus for ""getting cultured in nine weeks.""",Spring,"HIST 32510, GNSE 26255, SIGN 26225, GRMN 26225, GNSE 36255, GRMN 36225, HIST 22510",,Sophie Salvo and Alice Goff

A hidden history of 20th Century Art. 100 Units.,"The proliferation of straight lines in 20th Century art and architecture is generally associated with rational and universalist procedures and perspectives, and closely associated with the rise of industrial society. This course will look at straight lines in modern art from a very different perspective. We will study a hidden genealogy of straight lines that all seem to evoke the vagaries of sensory realities and capacities and that are aesthetic through and through. These type of straight lines are all, in their various ways, related to the close interaction between bodies and media technologies - one of the major themes in modern art. The question, of course, is how and why straight lines comes to express this relationship. To look at this question, we will study artworks and ideas that extend from the mid 19th-century to 21st century art and that includes a wide range of media and expressions, including architecture, painting, drawing, film, video and computer art.",Autumn,"ARTH 36501, CMST 36505, MADD 26501, CMST 26505",,I.

The course will then focus on contemporary avant-garde movements during the 1970s and 1980s, the response to urbanization in art at the onset of the new millennium, the influence of globalization since 2000, and a new generation of young artists from China as well as Chinese diasporic artists working transnationally. Critical attention will be paid to ways in which artists respond to the obsolescence of physical environments and interactions due to major investments in robotics, AI technologies, online communication platforms, and virtual monetary exchange applications. In addition to working with important secondary texts focused on contemporary art from China, students will have the unique opportunity to examine primary documents that I have obtained during my ongoing research activities in China.

Focusing on the United States, this course will reflect on the question by considering how design has variously embodied, represented, bound, made visible, excluded, unified and otherwise shaped groups of people and their commitments. The cases we consider will likely include: 19th century Shaker furniture, Depression-era efforts to build a visual index of historic American design, postwar advances in wheelchair design, Africobra poster design and political economy in 1960s Chicago, and graphic design for Chicano newspapers of the late '60s and early '70s.

These topics are essential knowledge for students studying Indigenous art and archaeology in their curriculum and who may be considering careers in related fields. That said, even scholars who do not directly study Indigenous art may someday find themselves responsible for it, whether as a department chair or museum director, making familiarity with these issues essential preparation. Ultimately, the curation of Indigenous art is shaping the leading edge of curatorial practice in museums today-as well as popular discourse.",Winter,ARTH 36810,,A. Hamilton
ARTH 26909,Realism: Art or Metaphysics? 100 Units.,"Besides its historical role as the first capital-letter avant-garde in painting and literature, Realism is making a return in many current artistic and, for that matter, cultural and journalistic contexts. But whether one examines its entanglement with reputed adversaries like Romanticism and Idealism, its origins in ancient and medieval metaphysics, or its strange side career as a label for amoral pragmatism in political theory and practice, the many-sidedness of realism makes pinning it down quite a challenge. Is there any common thread binding Plato and Courbet, Virginia Woolf and García Marquez, Catherine Opie and Ai Weiwei? Can there be a realism of dreams and desire, such as one might find in Freud? And is realism a revolutionary venture, or a consolidating surveillance of social types? What role do new technologies and forms of spectatorship, from oil painting to photography, the printed book to streaming media, play in its rise and evolution? Readings in art history, fiction, and philosophy will alternate with film screenings and gallery visits.",Autumn,ARTH 36909,,"A. Pop, M. Widrich"
ARTH 27314,Writing Art Criticism. 100 Units.,"This course is a practicum in writing art criticism. Unlike art historians, art critics primarily respond to the art of their time and to developments in the contemporary art world. They write reviews of Chicago exhibitions that may be on view in galleries or museums and that may focus on single artists or broad themes. Importantly, art critics often produce the very first discourse on a given art, shaping subsequent thinking and historiography. Accordingly, art criticism is a genre that requires particular skills, for example, identifying why and how artworks matter, taking a fresh look at something familiar or developing a set of ideas even if unfamiliar with a subject, expressing strong yet sound opinions, and writing in impeccable and engaging ways. Students will develop these skills by reading and writing art criticism. We will examine the work of modern art critics ranging from Denis Diderot to Peter Schjeldahl and of artists active as critics ranging from Donald Judd to Barbara Kruger. Class discussions will be as much about the craft of writing as about the art reviewed. We will deliberate the style and rhetoric of exhibition reviews, including details such as first and last sentences, order of paragraphs, word choices, and the like. This seminar is writing intensive with a total of six exhibition reviews, four of which will be rewritten substantially based on instructor, visitor, and peer feedback and general class discussion.

ARTH 27316,Crafting Modernity. 100 Units.,"This course proposes that craft defined artmaking in the United States during the the period after World War I and through to the post-World War II era. For the purposes of the course, craft will be broadly understood to encompass handmade items designed for practical use as well as artworks that, through concepts, materials, and/or processes, trace their lineage to a functional and handmade past. In framing this modernist history through craft, and discussing pedagogy, practitioners, objects,and theories of making, the course positions craft as a primary propagator of modernity. Artists with diverse material practices, such as Anni Albers, Emma Amos, Ruth Asawa, Faith Ringgold, and Lenore Tawney, will be central to the discussion and will foster an assessment and interrogation of craft's role in producing and popularizing modern art more broadly. In addition to foregrounding the ubiquity of craft and its wide-reaching impacts on culture and society (including educational initiatives and programs, exhibitions and museum collections, and publications), this course will also question craft's relative absence (until recently) in narratives oftwentieth-century modernism in the United States. Furthermore, while craft has the potential to surface the classism, sexism, and media hierarchies in modern art historical discourse, the need to critically examine craft's relationship with colonialism, racism, and sexism will also be addressed",Spring,ARTH 37316,,E.

The course begins with the discussion of the context in which the Buddha images were made in Amaravati and the factors including Buddhist doctrinal developments that contributed to the spread of these images to various parts of Sri Lanka. Then it traces the course and function of Buddhist iconography in Sri Lanka until into the 21st century to assess the role of geopolitical factors. The positionality and portrayals of the images of Buddha are also considered and analyzed. The course traces the trajectories that transformed the image of the Buddha from a symbol of peace to jingoist assertiveness. Through the study of the images of the Buddha, the aim is to comprehend the ways Buddhism has changed over centuries from an inclusive posture which helped it sustain and spread to different parts of the world only later to become exclusionary.",Winter,"SALC 37440, SALC 27440, ARTH 37440, RLST 27440, HIST 36704, RLVC 37440, HREL 37440",,Sree Padma Holt

Within and between today's urbanized areas, that seemingly simple question has become one of the most fraught and intractable problems. This course seeks to address questions about public transit across scales, from pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure at the level of individual intersections and blocks up to regional train networks and beyond. Like other design studio courses, the class will be project-based, and will ask students to develop a wide understanding of existing systems, but also to learn through creative design projects that expand their sense of what's possible. After working together to understand many existing transit solutions across different scales, to come to terms with and document Chicago's transit landscape, and to dream speculatively about untested transit possibilities both low- and high-tech, students will focus on building a portfolio of creative suggestions for their respective ""clients"" (e.g., the University of Chicago, the 4th Ward Alderman).

We will examine questions of Buddhology, of the diversity and range of conversations within early Buddhism, leading to the rise of the Mahāyāna, in relation to the visualization of Buddhist theory and narrative in the extensive and extraordinary decorations of the major sites. The course will introduce those taking it to the rich visual, material and epigraphic culture of the Buddhist stūpas as well as the vibrant textual world of Indian Buddhist writing - from stories to suttas to commentaries. Students will have the opportunity to develop their own final papers in relation to this material or comparatively with other material in which they also retain an interest (not necessarily only Buddhist).",Spring,"HREL 37490, RLVC 37490, SALC 27490, SALC 37490, RLST 27490, ARTH 37490",,Jaś Elsner

ARTH 27799,"Materiality and Artistic Intent: The Object, Conservation and Art History-Suzanne Deal Booth Seminar. 100 Units.","This course will investigate materiality in the context of art-historical study. Thirty years ago technical art history was a burgeoning field of study among a small number of museum conservators, curators and scientists. Today curatorial/conservation partnerships are common and analytic methods to examine and characterize artworks are sophisticated and often nondestructive. The intersection of the three disciplines - art history, conservation and materials science - has made it possible to study art in a more holistic and objective manner by understanding the art-making materials, the methods of using them, and the conscious choices made by artists to achieve their aesthetic goals. Additionally, changes to works of art, whether the result of inherent instability, external environmental factors, or artist's intent may be more readily identified and assessed. Case studies will be presented to show how artists' methods and materials can be informative within a broader art-historical context. The course will address the meaningful integration of technical study into one's own curatorial/art history practice. Students will examine works of art firsthand to determine the materials and methods used in their making, to assess their condition, and to see how various manipulations of different art-making materials inform their appearance. Students will evaluate selected readings and recent technical studies. Class participation is encouraged and expected.",Autumn,ARTH 37799,,H. Strauss
ARTH 28003,Islamic Art: Private Collections on Public Display. 100 Units.,"In the past decade, two museums in Texas - the MFA Houston and the Dallas Museum of Art -- have suddenly emerged as major centers for Islamic art. Usually, well-developed displays of Islamic art build on sustained institutional commitment to curation over several generations. However, these Texas museums both quickly transformed their abilities to exhibit Islamic art by securing long term loans of significant private collections. With the al-Sabah Collection and the Hossein Afshar Collection, MFA Houston more than doubled its display space for Islamic art in 2023; and similarly, the Dallas Museum of Art has displayed the Keir Collection since 2014. This travelling seminar brings students to Texas for two weeks, facilitating direct study of an expansive range of Islamic arts produced from the medieval period to the present, in materials ranging from silk, parchment, ceramic, and rock crystal; to lacquer, sandstone, metal, jade, and plexiglass. Students will learn basic classification systems for navigating the vast range of Islamic arts, and will also each select a specific work for close study. Upon return to campus, students will develop their thoughts on the object in relation to questions of collection and display. What force does a given object have in shaping, confirming, or challenging logics of collection and display?

ARTH 28201,Art on My Mind. 100 Units.,"A critic who began as an abstract painter, bell hooks (Gloria Watkins) was also a queer woman of color and among the most penetrating cultural observers in recent US history. This course centers on the close reading of hooks' 1995 book, Art on My Mind: Visual Politics, which fearlessly and sympathetically took as its subject a perennial conundrum wherein black artists and critics' relationship to art and aesthetics threatens to be subsumed by their efforts to challenge an art world bent on marginalization and exclusion. By hooks's own account, she designed this collection of essays and interviews to continue discussions of art and aesthetics begun in earlier work-specifically, to further engage the politics of feminism in conjunction with liberatory Black struggle. The result did a great deal more than this already considerable feat of intersectional study. Art on My Mind demonstrates then-new, still-woefully-underutilized means to think about visual art, write about visual art, and create actual spaces for 'dialogue across boundaries.' Art on My Mind, then, remains a model for confronting what addles critical consideration of the work of artists and cultural producers in all groups marginalized by structures of domination. This makes it also a book about transgression, and an excellent object to debate at a moment when generative meetings across boundaries seem increasingly unlikely.",Winter,"RDIN 38201, ARTH 38201, ARTV 38201, RDIN 28201, ARTV 28201",,D.

ARTH 28311,"Image, Iconoclasm, Animation. 100 Units.","This course will explore the fantasies of the animation of images both ancient and early Christian, both secular and sacred, as the backdrop to examining the phenomenon of iconoclasm as an assault on the image from pre-Christian antiquity via Byzantium to the Protestant Reformation. It will tackle both texts and images, the archaeological context of image-assault and the conceptual (indeed theological) contexts within which such assault was both justified and condemned. These historical issues cannot be separated, in our scholarly approaches and responses, from a vibrant contemporary culture around question of virtuality, animation, image-worship and image-destruction in the current world. The course will provide space to reflect on the problems raised by this. The course will be taught over the first four and a half weeks in the Spring Quarter on an intensive schedule.

ARTH 28325,Art and Description in Antiquity and Byzantium. 100 Units.,"This course explores the rich tradition of ekphrasis in Greco-Roman antiquity and Byzantium - as it ranges from vivid description in general to a specific engagement with works of art. While the prime focus will remain on texts from Greece, Rome and Byzantium - in order to establish what might be called the ancestry of a genre in the European tradition and especially its fascinating place between pagan polytheistic and Christian writing -- there will be opportunity in the final paper to range beyond this into questions of comparative literature, art (history) writing and ekphrasis in other periods or contexts, depending on students' interests and needs. A reading knowledge of Greek in particular could not be described as a disadvantage, but the course can be taken without knowing the ancient languages.

ARTH 28328,Africa's Byzantine Heritage: Religion and Art in Pluralistic Societies. 100 Units.,"This quarter-length course is conceived around themes and artifacts of an innovative special exhibition titled Africa & Byzantium at the Metropolitan Museum of Art that we will be visiting together (Feb. 16-18, 2024). It will be the first time a museum has showcased the important contributions of Africa's multiethnic societies to the cultural and religious life of the Christian Empire of Byzantium. In addition, the Met boasts a world-renowned permanent collection of Byzantine artifacts, several of which we will be studying as well during our field trip. The Byzantine Empire (4th cent.-1453) encompassed large parts of the Mediterranean, the Balkans, Anatolia, and the Middle East, with North and East Africa forming part of the empire from the fourth century CE to the Islamic conquest (early 7th cent.). Under Islamic rule, the African continent's Byzantine-Christian legacy continued to be influential and has a rich afterlife to this day. The field trip will enable students hone their competence in visual analysis through close-up study of artworks representing a range of artistic media and techniques. The classroom sessions will illuminate the historical and cultural framework in which the artifacts are situated. Africa's Byzantine heritage is an emerging field of study and in this course students who wish to pursue their own research projects will have ample opportunity to do so.

ARTH 28705,Christian Iconography. 100 Units.,"In Christian culture, visual images have for many centuries played a pivotal role in ritual, devotion, intellectual thought, and religious instruction. The most important aims of this course are that students understand images convey meaning in very unique ways and learn how to decode their visual messages. The study of iconography encompasses a variety of methods used to identify the subject matter of a pictorial image, describe its contents, and analyze its discursive strategies in view of its original cultural context. We will cover some of the most important themes visualized in the arts of Christianity by analyzing imagery spanning different periods, geographical regions, pictorial media, and artistic techniques. While special emphasis is placed on the intersections of art and literature, we will also examine pictorial themes that are independent of a specific textual basis. Alongside the study of Christian iconography, this course will address broader issues of visual inquiry, such as patronage, viewer response, emotions, and gender roles. In this course, students will acquire a 'visual literacy' that will enable them to explore all kinds of works of art fruitfully as primary sources in their own right. Students will be examined on the basis of an essay and one oral presentation of a work of art.

ARTH 29609,Realism: Art or Metaphysics? 100 Units.,"Besides its historical role as the first capital-letter avant-garde in painting and literature, Realism is making a return in many current artistic and, for that matter, cultural and journalistic contexts. But whether one examines its entanglement with reputed adversaries like Romanticism and Idealism, its origins in ancient and medieval metaphysics, or its strange side career as a label for amoral pragmatism in political theory and practice, the many-sidedness of realism makes pinning it down quite a challenge. Is there any common thread binding Plato and Courbet, Virginia Woolf and García Marquez, Catherine Opie and Ai Weiwei? Can there be a realism of dreams and desire, such as one might find in Freud? And is realism a revolutionary venture, or a consolidating surveillance of social types? What role do new technologies and forms of spectatorship, from oil painting to photography, the printed book to streaming media, play in its rise and evolution?

ASTR 12620,The Big Bang. 100 Units.,"The Big Bang model describes the Universe on the largest scales and its evolution from the earliest observationally accessible times through the formation of the complex world we live in today. This powerful framework allows us to interpret a wide range of observations and to make detailed and precise predictions for new experiments. The key motivating observations include the expansion of the Universe and how it has changed with time; the existence of radiation indicating a hot and dense early phase; the abundance of the light elements; and how matter is organized over a wide range of physical scales. The model naturally incorporates dark matter and dark energy, two surprising and poorly understood components that govern the growth of structure over time. The course will explore the history of scientific cosmology and the evidence for the Big Bang model, its consequences for the earliest moments after the Big Bang, and its predictions for the eventual fate of the Universe. Labs will include a hands-on measurement of the relic cosmic microwave background radiation from the early universe and the use of astronomical data to verify key discoveries in the history of Big Bang cosmology.

This course will outline the physical principles at work and the history of the development of the key ideas: how nuclear physics and the theory of stellar interiors account for how stars shine, why they live for such long times, and how the heavy elements in their cores are dispersed to form a new generation of stars. Gravity assembles stars out of more diffuse material, a process that includes the formation of planetary systems. The course shows how, taken together, these physical processes naturally lead to the ingredients necessary for the emergence of life, namely elements like carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and planets in stable orbits around long-lived stars.

ASTR 12710,Galaxies. 100 Units.,"Galaxies have been called island universes, places where stars are concentrated, where they are born, and where they die. The study of galaxies reaches back to the Renaissance; Galileo Galilei first pointed a telescope skyward in 1610 and confirmed a then 2000 year-old Greek conjecture about the nature of our own galaxy -- the Milky Way. This course will use extensive modern observational data from a wide range of telescopes to trace the modern picture for the formation and evolution of galaxies and the stars in them. Galaxies will then be used as markers of yet larger scale structures, in order to explore the influence of gravity over cosmic time. The object of study in this course is galaxies, and the narrative arc traced through that extensive data and understanding will highlight our profound discovery that most of the mass in galaxies (and the Universe as a whole) is in fact an exotic form of matter -- dark matter -- that we cannot directly see. Quantitative analysis will be an important part of the course in both laboratory work and lectures, but mathematics beyond algebra and some geometric understanding will not be required.

The stars we see in the night sky seem to extend indefinitely. Are they organized in some kind of structure? How far out do they go? What lies beyond the stars? Questions like these motivated much of the work at observatories in the years from 1890 to 1920. Thanks to technological advances in telescopes and photography during this period, significant progress was made in constructing maps that located the Solar System with respect to the surrounding ""system of the stars."" In this class we will explore the historical development of understanding the arrangement of things in space using resources that were available to the practitioners at the time: original photographic glass plates (mostly digitized files); star catalogs and maps; and scientific publications. To the extent possible, we will try to understand how the science looked from the perspective of astronomers a hundred years ago.

ASTR 23700,Histories of Women in Science. 100 Units.,"In the mid-1980s, only two female students drew women when asked what a scientist looked like and none of the male students in the study did. Only 8% of STEM workers in 1970 were women; in 2019 that number was still only 27%. This would seem to suggest that the history of women in science is a recent one. Yet historians of science have foregrounded women's involvement in fields ranging from early modern medicine to twentieth century astrophysics. This class introduces students to these histories, investigates how and why science came to be a gendered as male, and asks to what extent gendered values continue to inform modern conceptions scientific achievement or value. In so doing, this course also introduces students to feminist science studies and challenges students to reflect upon their own (gendered) experiences of science. Students are strongly encouraged to develop final research projects that draw upon their own interests, scientific expertise, and linguistic competencies. No prior experience with history is required for this course, although an enthusiasm for history is advised.",Winter,"CHSS 37011, GNSE 37011, GNSE 23162, PHSC 27010, HIPS 27011, KNOW 37011, HIST 27806",,Kristine Palmieri

The evidence for this remarkable fact comes from galactic dynamics, the clustering of matter on cosmological scales, the cosmic microwave background, gravitational lensing, and the yields of light elements formed shortly after the big bang. However, despite this vast body of evidence, the microscopic nature of dark matter is currently unknown and there are many candidate theories which make different predictions about its non-gravitational interactions with visible matter. In this course we will survey the evidence for the existence of dark matter, introduce some of the most commonly studied theories (e.g. WIMPs and axions), and explore their testable implications.",Winter,,ASTR 24100 for Astrophysics Majors; PHYS 23410 for Physics Majors.

Their history is assumed to be one of revelations and discoveries, beginning with the Greeks and reaching final maturity in modern Europe. This narrative has been roundly critiqued for decades, but the work of rewriting these histories has only just begun. This course is designed to familiarize students with a growing literature on the history of mathematics and astronomy in regions which now make up the global south. It is structured as a loosely chronological patchwork of counterexamples to colonial histories of mathematics and astronomy. Thematic questions include: How were mathematical and astronomical knowledge conjoined? How were they embedded in political contexts, cultural practices, and forms of labor? How did European scientific modernity compose itself out of the knowledges of others? Where necessary, we will engage with older historiographies of mathematics and astronomy, but for the most part we will move beyond them.

BIOS 26403,Quantitative Immunobiology. 100 Units.,"The science of immunology was born at the end of the 19th century as a discipline focused on the body's defenses against infection. The following 120+ years has led to the discovery of a myriad of cellular and molecular players in immunity, placing the immune system alongside the most complex systems such as Earth's global climate and the human brain. The functions and malfunctions of the immune system have been implicated in virtually all human diseases. It is thought that cracking the complexity of the immune system will help manipulate and engineer it against some of the most vexing diseases of our times such as AIDS and cancer. To tackle this complexity, immunology in the 21st century - similar to much of the biological sciences - is growing closer to mathematics and data sciences, physics, chemistry and engineering. A central challenge is to use the wealth of large datasets generated by modern day measurement tools in biology to create knowledge, and ultimately predictive models of how the immune system works and can be manipulated.

CMST 10664,Poetry and Cinema. 100 Units.,"On the surface, poetry and film may seem to have little in common. But over the course of the twentieth century, many poets took a serious interest in film and engaged with it as screenwriters and critics, as well as in their poetry. Likewise, many filmmakers looked to poetry as a model for how movies could work; for some, poetry (not fiction or drama) was film's artistic next of kin. This course takes a broad, multi-national survey of poetry and film from the 1920s to the 1970s. How did writers and filmmakers understand the relationship between the two mediums? What kinds of resources and challenges did each medium pose to the other? Poets on the syllabus may include Gertrude Stein, H.D., Langston Hughes, César Vallejo, Salvador Novo, Xavier Villaurrutia, Benjamin Fondane, Pierre Reverdy, and Pier Paolo Pasolini. Likely filmmakers include Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Sergei Eisenstein, Dudley Murphy, Kenneth Macpherson, Fernando de Fuentes, Maya Deren, Jean Cocteau, Kenneth Anger, and Stan Brakhage.

CMST 14570,Special Topics: Animation Theory. 100 Units.,"Due to the ubiquity and pervasiveness of animation in contemporary media ecologies, recent years have seen a surge of interest in animation theory. But animation theory presents a vast and turbulent domain of inquiry, because animation may be narrowly defined as a set of objects or techniques or broadly conceptualized to embrace questions about life and death, about more-than-human animals, artificial life, and animism, for instance. This topics course has two aims. The first aim is to provide an overview of the key problematics of and approaches to animation theory in a global and historical perspective. The second aim is to develop tools for doing animation theory in a more localized manner. To this end, course will highlight theories of character and characterization with an emphasis on how the inherent tension between individual and type in animation affects our understanding race and racism.",Winter,"MADD 14570, EALC 14570",,Thomas Lamarre
CMST 14578,Media Technologies. 100 Units.,"This class is only offered through the Study Abroad Program in Paris. This course offers tools for understanding and theorizing media by attending to technology. Students will learn to think about the materiality of media, asking how media technologies-such as television, the mp3 format, or a mobile phone app-influence the contents or meanings they transmit, as well as the ways in which discourses and practices shape the nature of media and its technical infrastructures. What forms have culture and knowledge taken as the emergence of new media has reconfigured lived experience, social life, and power relations? We will consider the ways in which technology extends beyond the realm of machinery-how practices, regulations, beliefs and environments become part of the systematic deployment of media from content moderation to the cooling of servers. Examples of media discussed in class will include student-curated collections of social media content, videogames and television by French creators, and even infrastructural systems, including a failed project to create an automated train system in Paris.",Winter.

This course will investigate the raw materials and basic forms at the disposal of artists working in and across these media, with a special focus on horror as a genre. Along with fundamental questions regarding the social, psychological, and political uses (and abuses) of horror as a genre, this course will also look at how horror works across a variety of media. In what way do the possibilities available to game developers differ from those available to filmmakers, and vice versa? How are space, time, and action presented and segmented differently across moving images (cinema), interactive moving images (games), and fully-immersive virtual environments (VR)? How do techniques ranging from psychological identification to jump scares work in each medium, and what aesthetic effects are open to one that are not open to the other?

CMST 20122,From Bollywood to Made in Heaven: Marriage and Sexuality on Indian Screens. 100 Units.,"From reality shows like Indian Matchmaking and Made in Heaven to the meme of the ""Big Fat Indian Wedding"" to the preoccupations of Bollywood films like DDLJ and Rocky aur Rani ki Prem Kahani and crossover ones such as Monsoon Wedding, marriage is an obsession in South Asian culture. Focusing on Hindi cinema, this course will explore the socio-political dynamics of this cultural focus on marriage and couple formation. With examples ranging from classical Hindi films from the 1950s-60s to the star-studded melodramas of 1970s and 1980s and the ""new Bollywood"" era (post-1991), this cinema exhibited and analyzed the central dynamics of marriage: sexual compatibility, fidelity, reproductive futures, and so on. Debates around class, caste, diaspora, and sexuality are equally anchored in issues of marriage and couple formation. In this course, we ask why it is that marriage-its success and failure-has been so central to Indian on-screen identities. Even as screens multiply-on computers, cell phones, and in the multiplex-marriage continues to dominate. No prior knowledge of Indian languages is required, but you must enjoy watching and talking about movies and popular culture.",Winter,"GNSE 30142, SALC 20122, SALC 30122, GNSE 20142, HIST 36616, CMST 30122, HIST 26616",,Rochona Majumdar
CMST 20550,Writing the TV Pilot. 100 Units.,"The creation of a TV Pilot is a unique, exciting, and demanding task for a writer. In addition to the responsibility of telling a compelling story, writers are also charged with setting up a ""world"" and establishing characters and plotlines that will sustain the show over multiple episodes and seasons. In this class, we will delve into the processes required to succeed in this challenging endeavor. This includes creation of pitch materials, plot and character development, outlining, creation of a show bible, and ultimately, writing the pilot episode of an original TV series. The classroom will function as part development workshop and part informal TV writer's room. Through weekly reading and writing assignments we will dissect successful entries into the TV space and tap into our artistic inspirations to evolve our show concepts. From there, we would collaborate as a class by actively brainstorming and workshopping our scripts and series. By the end of the quarter, each student will complete a draft of an original pilot script, as well as a short ""Series Bible"" detailing the broader scope of the show.",,"MADD 20550, TAPS 25550",,
CMST 20600,"Gender, Race, and Horror. 100 Units.","This course will contend with the ways that horror as a film genre constructs and deconstructs notions of gender and race in society. We will attend to texts across decades and subgenres that will illustrate how gender and race are made and regulated through notions of confusion, fear, and repulsion. By attending to these universal human feelings, students will learn how emotions are evoked through the construction of the text, its portrayal of the disruption of gender norms and its construction of racial boundaries. Students will learn the necessary vocabulary and methodologies to be able to critically analyze (audio)visual texts. In order to do this, students will be guided through how to construct argumentative critical papers through proper utilization of grammar, syntax, and vocabulary. By the end of the course, students will be well versed in cinematographic terms such that they will be able to critically analyze texts to understand the impact of perspective, interpretation, and judgment. This course is meant to help students navigate and make sense of an increasingly scary world by learning to appreciate fear as a necessary human expression. Finally, and most importantly, students will be able to engage with the age-old notion of terror to be able lead a more ethical and intellectually richer life.",Autumn,,,AE Stevenson
CMST 20602,Queer/Trans/Media. 100 Units.,"This seminar stages a sustained dialogue between theories of queer, trans, and media, exploring how each of these disciplines animate and challenge one another. This course explores the possibilities of an expanded understanding of queerness, following queer scholar Eve Sedgwick's claim that ""work around 'queer' spins the term outward along dimensions that can't be subsumed under gender and sexuality at all."" More recently, queer scholars like David Eng have read ""queerness as a critical methodology based not on content but rather on form and style"" while trans scholars like Toby Beauchamp similarly engage ""the transgender of transgender studies as a mode of critique"" and ""not as a predetermined category into which identities or bodies are slotted."" What might it mean to consider ""queer"" and ""trans"" not as a field with a delimited object of study (sexuality or gender), but as an analytic, a methodology, a critical sensibility, a conceptual strategy, a reading practice, a politics, an aesthetic, etc. Throughout the course, we explore often-unconventional pairings of media objects and scholarly readings to work through these challenging questions. Ultimately, this course is designed to help students read for the similarities within the aesthetic forms of film/media and queer/trans theories to understand their force of expression.",Spring,GNSE 23169,,Basil Dababneh
CMST 21003,Early Black Film and its Afterlives. 100 Units.,"In an oft-cited statistic, the Library of Congress has estimated that over 70% of the films produced between 1912 and 1929, are now lost forever. The outcomes for black film during this period are even more stark. This course takes on the challenge of narrating a history dominated by absence, pairing careful historiographic methods with creative and speculative approaches to construct the life and afterlife of early black filmmaking. In this class, we will explore the historical development of black film and black film performance throughout the silent era and its boundaries, from the earliest fragments to the beginnings of the sound era. We will explore key figures such as Oscar Micheaux, Richard E. Norman, and William D. Foster, as well as key performers like Paul Robeson, Bert Williams, Evelyn Preer and Josephine Baker. In addition to watching and engaging with the films themselves, we will explore the contexts of their production, the theatrical and musical traditions that informed them, and material life of the celluloid that carries them. We will also attend to the films now ""lost forever."" What can we know about a film we cannot watch, and how? We will consider partial film material, news reporting and other ephemera in an attempt to peer into the space left behind in the absence of a surviving film print. Lastly, we will study the citation, sampling, remixing, and reimagining of this material from this era in contemporary work.",Winter,,,Avery LaFlamme

We will examine the range of Black feminisms presented through film and the ways that these films have challenged, countered, and reimagined dominant narratives about race, class, gender, and sexuality in America. We will explore the power and limitations of filmmaking as a mode of Black feminist activism; the range of Black feminisms presented through film; and the specific filmic engagements of well-known Black feminist critics such as bell hooks, Toni Cade Bambara, and Michele Wallace. As many Black feminist writers were engaged with filmmaking and film culture, we will look at these films alongside Black women's creative and critical writing from the period. Approaching filmmaking in the context of Black feminist thought will allow us to examine the possibilities of interdisciplinary approaches to film studies broadly, as well as to think specifically about the research methods and theories that are demanded by Black women's filmmaking in particular.",Winter,"CMST 31025, CRES 21025, GNSE 20128, HMRT 31025, GNSE 30128, HIST 27415, HMRT 21025, HIST 37415, KNOW 31025",This course is open to graduate and undergraduate students from across the disciplines; our conversations and presentations of the films will both depend on and be energized by different disciplinary perspectives.,Allyson Field

À l'appui de textes dont nous privilégierons ceux originellement publiés en français, nous examinerons une grande variété de films dont le point commun se situe à leur opposition à la norme, au centre, à la métropole, au mainstream. L'œuvre de cinéastes issus des rives gauche et droite de la Nouvelle Vague, tels que Chabrol, Duras, Godard et Varda, celle de cinéastes africains, et de cinéastes de l'âge classique et moderne comme Alice et Mati Diop, permettra de passer du macro au micro, du personnel à l'autoréférentiel. Nous étudierons ainsi comment ces cinéastes utilisent l'outil cinématographique pour aborder des thèmes tels que la colonisation, la géographie, le genre et la sexualité, et le medium du cinéma lui-même.

CMST 21401,"Refresh, Reload, Reboot, Remake: What are film remakes good for? 100 Units.","Film remakes are, and have been, a ubiquitous phenomenon in popular cinema. Film remakes take many shapes and forms: transnational (from Japan to the US), transcultural (from French to American), trans-modal (from animation to live action), and trans-medial (from games to the cinema screen). This course takes up the remake as not merely a citation, but as a new object that, in repeating, creates new meanings. It treats the remake as a repository where one can not only find new technologies of seeing and showing, but also track changing ways of imagining the world on cinema. For this course, then, the film remake serves as an emblem of difference, one which contains the situated imaginations of films past and present. By studying the remake, the goal of this class is to come out with a better understanding of cinema's difference from the other arts in its capacity to repeat the same story to produce different results.",Autumn,,,Shubham Shivang
CMST 21402,South Side Home Movies: Amateur Cinema and the Politics of Preservation. 100 Units.,"This course traces the history of amateur filmmaking on Chicago's South Side as a robust creative practice and mode of documentation revealing realms of moving image production and presentation grounded in everyday life. With the rise of scholarship on nontheatrical media, home movies have become a critical area of cinema studies and archiving. This course centers on the South Side Home Movie Project, founded by the instructor, housed at the University of Chicago's Arts + Public initiative/Film Studies Center. The collection has more than 1,000 reels of small-gauge (8mm, 16mm) films from the 1930s-1970s from a diverse range of South Side residents, with scenes of family and community gatherings, life milestones and more. We will engage in close readings of films in the archive to consider their styles and intended audiences. We will examine how they picture the South Side in an era of intense racial segregation, as discussed by writers, e.g., Horace Cayton, St. Clair Drake, etc. We will also discuss the SSHMP's approaches to stewarding this footage in relation to developments in film archival praxis, and tensions that crop up between preservation and access. Lectures and discussions with SSHMP staff, donors and collaborators will cover digitization, cataloguing, oral history, public programming, and engagement with filmmaker families, educators, and artists.

Sociological and psychological studies have underscored the importance of female roles in relation to mafia organizations, notwithstanding the rigid patriarchal structure that allows only male affiliation. One of the main goals of this class is for students to gain an understanding of different Italian mafias and to get a deeper comprehension of the construction of gender in a selection of films centered around these organizations.

CMST 22500,Seeing Islam and the Politics of Visual Culture. 100 Units.,"From terrorists to ""good Muslims,"" standards in the racial, cultural, and religious representations surrounding Islam have fluctuated across U.S. media. How do we conceptualize the nature of visual perception and reception? The history of colonialism, secular modernity, gender, patriarchy, and the blurred distinctions between religion and racialization have all contributed to a milieu of visual cultures that stage visions of and arguments about Islam. Hostility towards Muslims has not abated as we venture well into the 21st century, and many remain quick to blame an amorphous media for fomenting animosity towards the ""real"" Islam. We use these terms of engagement as the start of our inquiry: what is the promise of a meaningful image? What processes of secular translation are at work in its creation and consumption? Is there room for resistance, legibility, and representation in U.S. popular culture, and what does representation buy you in this age? We will pair theoretical methods for thinking about imagery, optics, perception, and perspective alongside case studies from film, stage, comedy, streaming content, and television shows, among others. Students will critically engage and analyze these theories in the contexts from which these works emerge and meld into a mobile and diasporic U.S. context.

One can practically trace a line from early hits like Survivor and Big Brother, which were quickly formatted for global circulation, to the recent viral success of Squid Game, a fictionalized account of a death-game tournament that spawned its own reality show. Why do audiences everywhere find reality TV so entertaining? What moral lessons do viewers take away from these shows? And what might scholars learn by taking this popular aesthetic form, in all its cultural variation, seriously? This course brings together media studies, aesthetic criticism, area studies, and the sociology of religion to try to answer some of these questions. The course will help students to think about the moral and spiritual beliefs embedded in popular cultural forms, but also to understand how these forms are now circulated and consumed in our contemporary media environment and what they tell us about late-stage global capitalism. Course readings will introduce students to scholarship in television studies, aesthetic criticism, religious studies, and cultural studies, providing them with the necessary foundations to analyze reality TV from multiple disciplinary perspectives.

CMST 24110,India on Film. 100 Units.,"This course introduces you to the different ways in which we might think about India through films. What was/is India on-screen? To what extent was India produced by these filmic imaginations? To be sure, there was/ is no monolithic India represented in film. Over the course of the quarter, we will focus on some important films to chart the idea of India they constructed and held up for critique. We will also focus on the region within the nation. In what ways does ""Bombay"" cinema overlap with ""Tamil"" ""Bengali"" and/ or Malayalam cinemas? What are its overlaps with ""Lahore"" cinema both before and after India and Pakistan became sovereign states? Our films will cover a wide temporal range: from the classical period of Indian cinema into the era of globalization in the 21st century. They will include popular , documentary, and art films. Our goal will to be understand the relationship between films and emergent ideas of nationhood, modernity, and citizenship in a decolonial world.

CMST 24405,Kieslowski's French Cinema. 100 Units.,"Krzysztof Kieślowski's The Decalogue and The Double Life of Veronique catapulted the Polish director to the international scene. His subsequent French triptych Blue, White, Red turned out to be his last works that altered his image and legacy to affirm his status as an auteur and a representative of the transnational cinema. We discuss how in his virtual universe of parallel histories and repeated chances, captured with visually and aurally dazzling artistry, the possibility of reconstituting one's identity, triggered by tragic loss and betrayal, reveals an ever-ambiguous reality. By focusing on the filmmaker's dissolution of the thing-world, often portrayed on the verge of vague abstraction of (in)audibility or (un)transparency, this course bridges his cinema with the larger concepts of postmodern subjectivity and possibility of metaphysics. The course concludes with the filmmaker's contribution to world cinema. All along, we read selections from Kieślowski's and Piesiewicz's screen scripts, Kieślowski's own writings and interviews, as well as from the abundant criticism of his French movies. All materials are in English.",TBD,"CMLT 24405, FNDL 25312, REES 31002, REES 21002, CMST 34405",,Bozena Shallcross

CMST 25025,Mexican Cinema. 100 Units.,"This course is intended as an overview of Mexican cinema, from its famed ""Golden Age"" in the 1940s and 1950s, up to contemporary productions. The aim is to reflect simultaneously on Mexican culture, history, and society, and on the language of film and its interpretation. Our goal is to expand what we know about Mexico through the way its cinema has tackled questions of difference (class, gender, regional, and race-based), modernization, political unrest, inequality, violence, and love. Crucial to our academic setting, we will ask what films offer as objects of knowledge in their own right, and not merely as illustrations. What does it mean to analyze a film? What are the tools we use to read and write about them as cultural products? We will consider classic fiction features along short, experimental, and documentary films. Works discussed include Él (Luis Buñuel, 1953), Macario (Roberto Gavaldón, 1960), Canoa (Felipe Cazals, 1975), Perfume de violetas (Marisa Sistach, 2001), Tempestad (Tatiana Huezo, 2016), among others.",Autumn,"LACS 25025, SPAN 25025",,Luis Madrigal

Departing from Richard Wagner's revolutionary darkening of the auditorium in the late 19th century, this course considers the emergence of cinema as a social institution and site of desire, fantasy and fulfilment in the broader German cultural context. Close readings of canonic films including Der blaue Engel, Die Büchse der Pandora, La Habanera and Die Ehe der Maria Braun will be guided by literary and theoretical texts on the formation of the film viewer as a sensuous subject. We will integrate journalistic writings on sexuality, degeneracy and bourgeois morality in the public sphere and the historical phenomenon of modern stardom associated with the careers of Marlene Dietrich, Louise Brooks and Zarah Leander. Films by Joseph von Sternberg, G. W. Pabst, Douglas Sirk, Helmut Käutner and Rainer Werner Fassbinder are accompanied by texts by Irmgard Keun, Lotte H.

CMST 25507,"Gender, Race, and Horror. 100 Units.","This course will contend with the ways that horror as a film genre constructs and deconstructs notions of gender and race in society. We will attend to texts across decades and subgenres that will illustrate how gender and race are made and regulated through notions of confusion, fear, and repulsion. By attending to these universal human feelings, students will learn how emotions are evoked through the construction of the text, its portrayal of the disruption of gender norms and its construction of racial boundaries. Students will learn the necessary vocabulary and methodologies to be able to critically analyze (audio)visual texts. In order to do this, students will be guided through how to construct argumentative critical papers through proper utilization of grammar, syntax, and vocabulary. By the end of the course, students will be well versed in cinematographic terms such that they will be able to critically analyze texts to understand the impact of perspective, interpretation, and judgment. This course is meant to help students navigate and make sense of an increasingly scary world by learning to appreciate fear as a necessary human expression. Finally, and most importantly, students will be able to engage with the age-old notion of terror to be able lead a more ethical and intellectually richer life.",Autumn,"MADD 10507, CMST 35507, GNSE 20132",,AE Stevenson

We will take as our point of departure the films of Rettinger, Ruttmann, Fischinger, McLaren, and Breer, but will also draw upon artifacts and 'animated lines' taken from further afield: found footage films and algorithmic editing, dance drawings of Trisha Brown, kinetic sculptures of Bit International, early plotter art, avant-garde music notation, and contemporary techniques of motion and performance capture. This course will develop theoretical lines of inquiry that run in two directions: an excavation of a ""pre-history"" of contemporary new media and a reinterpretation / re-invigoration of our understanding of early animation. Any film production, hand-animation or computer programming experiences are welcome - but none are perquisites for the course.

The goal is not only to provide insight into Japanese animation within the context of Japan but also to consider those factors that have transformed it into a global cultural form with a diverse, worldwide fanbase. As such, the course approaches Japanese animation from three distinct perspectives on Japanese animation, which are designed to introduce students to three important methodological approaches to contemporary media - film studies, media studies, and fan studies or cultural studies. As we look at Japanese animation in light of these different conceptual frameworks, we will also consider how its transnational dissemination and 'Asianization' challenge some of our basic assumptions about global culture, which have been shaped primarily through the lens of Americanization.",Spring,"EALC 25620, CMST 35620, EALC 35620, MADD 15620, SIGN 26070",,Thomas Lamarre

This experimental course explores the emerging genre of ""alternate reality"" or ""transmedia"" gaming. Throughout the quarter, we will approach new media theory through the history, aesthetics, and design of transmedia games. These games build on the narrative strategies of novels, the performative role-playing of theater, the branching techniques of electronic literature, the procedural qualities of video games, and the team dynamics of sports. Beyond the subject matter, students will design modules of an Alternate Reality Game in small groups. Students need not have a background in media or technology, but a wide-ranging imagination, interest in new media culture, or arts practice will make for a more exciting quarter.",Autumn,"ENGL 25970, MADD 20700, CMST 35954, ARTV 30700, BPRO 28700, ARTV 20700, ENGL 32314, TAPS 28466","PQ: Third- or fourth-year standing.

The subject matter to which Forman was drawn translated into his cinema with a signature bittersweet tone, emphatic narrative cogency, and lush spontaneity. This course is an intensive study of Forman's work from his ""New Wave"" work in Czechoslovakia (Loves of a Blonde, The Fireman's Ball) to his U.S. studio successes (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Amadeus), to his idiosyncratic and parabolic last films (Man on the Moon, Goya's Ghosts).

How do we understand the ""material world"" in relation to cinema, and how does the film camera mediate it? What does the process of mediation look like when the goal of cinema is not solely to represent but also change the world? This course will pair theoretical readings on new materialist approaches to cinema with select case studies drawn from Chinese and Soviet revolutionary cinema. Our primary aim is twofold: to introduce students to the ""material turn"" in cinema and media studies, and to reflect on what the specific fields of Soviet and Chinese Film Studies bring to the discussion. We will look closely at works by socialist filmmakers in the twentieth century who argued that cinema had a special role to play in mediating and transforming the material world. How does socialist cinema seek to orient its viewer to a particular relationship to objects? How does it treat the human relationship to the environment? How does it regard the material of film and the process of filmmaking itself? Ultimately, the course will familiarize students with diverse understandings of materiality and materialism and with key figures and works in global socialist cinema. Readings and screenings will range from the Soviet avant-garde of the 1920s to Chinese revolutionary cinema of the early 1970s, and conclude with recent documentary and video experiments that engage with their legacies.",Spring,"CMST 36611, REES 36600, EALC 26611, EALC 36611, CMLT 26602, REES 26600, CMLT 36602",,Anne Eakin Moss and Paola Iovene

Major animating questions include: How do the fantasies of incarceration presented in fictional films emerge from and feed into societal-wide ideologies around mass incarceration? How can the relationship between cinematic technologies and surveillance society best be interrogated? Can documentary filmmaking affect radical change around issues of incarceration-and how can incarcerated people tell their own stories and represent their own lives?",Winter,CMST 37006,,Ian Jones

CMST 27105,Mediating War. 100 Units.,"This course will explore the reciprocal relationships between war and media. At the core of this class we will ask: how is war itself a medium? In doing so, we will consider not only the technologies used to wage war, but also how war operates as a material and conditioning substrate for experiences of time, space, and power. Indeed, war is not simply a state of armed conflict, but a mode of aesthetic and political communication that shapes modern sensoria. Beginning with key frameworks for war in media studies, we will proceed by examining a range of medial sites used to wage war, as well as documentary and entertainment practices that represent war for the public. Along the way, we will interrogate how the mediating processes of war conflate civilian and soldier, violence and entertainment, weapon and communication device. With historical references, this course will focus primarily on global experiences of armed conflict in the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries. In addition to specific war technologies like drones, we will also analyze key media forms like photography, cinema, television, computers, and video games.",Autumn,,,G. Kafer

CMST 27301,Philosophy of Comedy: Classic Hollywood Film. 100 Units.,"What does comedy do to us? What is the nature of our corporeal response of laughter and how does it relate to our intellectual, aesthetic, and emotional responses? What kind of philosophical perspective does the mode of comedy provide on issues of self-knowledge, agency, identity, taste, free will, gender, race, the relation of body to mind? In this course, we will use classic Hollywood film comedies as a field for exploring these questions. From the slapstick acrobatics of Chaplin and Keaton in the silent comedies, to the madcap horseplay of the Marx Brothers and the tapdancing of the Nicholas Brothers in the musical comedies, to the spitfire exchanges on the topic of sex and love in the screwball comedies and the metatheatrical Nazi impersonations in the wartime comedies, these films of the first half of the 20th century offer a wealth of performances, narratives, and gags for philosophical investigation. The course will provide an introduction to the major comedic directors and performers of this period. We will engage closely with the formal construction of individual films as well as on the nature of comedy itself. A major theme will be the contradictory power of the film comedy, its capacity for transgression and its reliance on stereotypes, its utopian transformative potential and its entanglements with death, despair, and violence.",Spring,,,Tanya Desai
CMST 27302,Projections of the Self: Acting on Film. 100 Units.,"In this course, we will study the topic of acting and performance on film through philosophical understandings of selfhood: is to be a self simply to play a role (existentialism)? Are we driven to act in ways we don't control (psychoanalysis)? What is the relation between the mind and the body (phenomenology)? Can the inner be accessed only through the outer (behaviorism)? Does gender exist only in performance (feminism)? What are the responsibilities of the self to the other (moral philosophy)? We will trace the history of theories and practices of film acting, covering topics around the transformations of actor into character, degrees of emotional inhabitation and the powers of stardom. Concurrently, we will analyze individual films and the perspectives they offer on questions of agency, will, consciousness, emotional expression, the unconscious, and social roles. Readings will include philosophical texts, film theory, as well as acting manuals and star interviews. Screenings will range across different movements and styles of international cinema.",Autumn,,,Tanya Desai
CMST 27806,Algorithmic Culture. 100 Units.,"The term algorithm has existed for centuries. However as technical systems, algorithms have only more recently started to shape contemporary social relations. From PredPol to ChatGPT, algorithms have inserted themselves into human knowledge and social experience across global information systems. In doing so, they have become the new site of culture insofar as they modulate human experiences and construct normative ways of meaning-making by correlating new relations among data, optimizing outputs, and automating decisions. Through the lens of digital media studies, this class will track how algorithms have reshaped culture relations by reconfiguring received frameworks of objectivity, identity, and power. Beginning with historical and technical accounts of algorithms, we will explore their impact through key issues including: personalization, discrimination, violence, labor, infrastructure, and the environment. The course will conclude by examining how algorithms open up new paths for resistance and sovereignty. Along the way, we will engage algorithms through vectors of social identity, including race, gender, class, and sexuality. As algorithms are a complex and multifaceted concept, our study of it will be interdisciplinary. In addition to foundational texts in digital media studies, we will engage a variety of materials from computer science, critical race studies, social sciences, queer and feminist studies, history, communications, and more.",Spring,,,Gary Kafer
CMST 27807,Work and Play in the Digital Age: Video Games and Social Media. 100 Units.,"Digital media has changed what work looks like across all sectors while simultaneously facilitating more play than ever before. The particularities of mediation are key to the current blurring of work and play: in our play time, video games and social media are feeling more and more like work, as gamification and content creation increasingly become the primary modes of interaction. And work feels more like a game as bosses are replaced by algorithms and all anyone wants to do is 'game the system.' Surveillance ecosystems abound, capturing our data and quantifying our actions, rendering us all working players in a socially mediated video game of life. Making video games for a living or becoming a social media star are jobs that, while fun and highly sought after, are paradigmatic of the contemporary work environment: precarious, aspirational, passion driven, and full of work and play. What happens to us when we're working and playing, at the same time, all the time? How can the frameworks of mass gameplay and ubiquitous sociality help us theorize the contemporary moment?",Spring,,,Bret Hart
CMST 27817,Sonic the Hedgehog. 100 Units.,"In this course, we will use a single franchise - Sonic the Hedgehog - as an access point to study media history, aesthetics, social and cultural practice, and the relationships between games, film, and other artforms. Originally released in 1991 for Sega's Genesis console, the Sonic series has spawned over three decades of games, cartoons, manga, novels, films, music, board games, action figures, fan art, cosplay, and merchandizing. Both the volume and the variety of these texts allow the Sonic corpus to be a focal point for questions with broader stakes for the study of games and media in general. Some of the questions we will be considering in this course include: What has been the relationship between particular videogame characters and franchises and the business practices and strategies of entertainment industries? What form does stardom take in the world of digital games, and is it an appropriate concept to apply to a mascot like Sonic? How have established game franchises responded to major technological and aesthetic shifts in the medium? How might we understand the concept and practice of adaptation as applied to the digital games, and what does it reveal about the medium specificity of and the relationship between games, film, comics, novels, and other forms? What can a game franchise that has taken a wide variety of generic forms (platforming, racing, fighting, and pinball, to name just a few) tell us about how genre works as concept and system in digital games?",Spring,"CMST 37817, MADD 17817, MAPH 37817",,Chris Carloy
CMST 27830,A Workshop on Creative Coding for New Media. 100 Units.,"This project-based, workshop-style course will offer a close look at how we can be creative with code at a crucial moment in the always-shifting relationships between computation, creativity, material, and audience. En route, we'll examine a dizzying array of contemporary creative-coding environments in both production and live performance, explore historical dead-ends, half-baked visions, long-forgotten programming languages, as well as yet-to-emerge interfaces and altogether imaginary futures. And we'll draw on examples from new media, music and sound art, cinema and VR, computer games, architecture and CAD/CAM. Our work together will be done in the context of extending and reworking Field --- an open-source environment for creative coding developed for use in a teaching role here at UChicago.

CMST 27845,The Transmedia Franchise: Alien (1979) and Its Offspring. 100 Units.,"We live in a franchise era where popular narratives unfold across multiple different media platforms: cinema, television, games, comics, novels, theme park rides, and more. This course explores the cultural, industrial, and technological factors driving this situation, as well as the opportunities and challenges that it presents for media creators. As our main example, we will delve into the Alien franchise, launched by the science fiction-horror film Alien (1979) and continuing across an increasing number of extensions, including a new film (Alien: Romulus [2024]), television series (Alien: Earth [2025]), and VR video game (Alien: Rogue Incursion [2024]). Each week, we will watch one of the Alien feature films, analyze its visual and narrative style, situate it in the historical development of transmedia strategies, and connect it to related works in other media. Screenings will be complemented by game play sessions at the Weston Game Lab. Readings will survey the vast literature on the Alien franchise while also introducing key theoretical concepts (e.g. transmedia, remediation, intertextuality, subcreation, convergence etc.). Therefore, although it is organized around Alien media, by the end of this course students will be prepared to think critically and creatively about the many franchises that structure our media environment.",Winter,,,Cooper Long
CMST 27867,1990s Videogame History. 100 Units.,"This course will trace developments in the videogame medium and videogame cultures in the final decade of the 20th century, discuss the unique possibilities and difficulties arising from the study of recent history, and put these discussions into practice through research-based assignments. Questions that will guide our study include: what was the relationship between technological innovations and stylistic changes in the videogame medium? How did the entry of new corporate and creative players into the business affect industrial structures and strategies? What do we make of ""freedom,"" ""realism,"" and other concepts that dominated videogame press coverage - and how were they connected to broader cultural discourses? How did understandings of what it meant to play videogames, and the types of experiences that videogames could offer, change over the course of the decade? What was the relationship between developments in the videogame medium and other media - from film and fiction to virtual reality and the Internet?

CMST 27880,Videogame Consoles: A Platform Studies Approach. 100 Units.,"While videogames' mix of art, play, and advanced technology gives game studies much of its vitality, the technological and computational aspects of the medium can be daunting for many would-be students and designers. And yet no approach to the study of videogames can be exhaustive without some consideration of the material and technological grounds that make games possible. With this in mind, this course will introduce approaches to videogame studies that emphasize the platforms - the hardware, operating systems, etc. - on which games are played, and is intended for students with all levels of familiarity with the technological side of videogames. How do the various components of game platforms, from computer architecture to controllers to the underlying code, affect how games look, sound, and feel, how they are played, who designs them and how, how they are marketed and to whom, and how they are preserved? How do platforms emerge from particular technological, industrial, social, and cultural contexts, and how do they in turn affect the course of game history and culture? Classroom lectures and discussions of readings will be accompanied by weekly gameplay sessions at the MADD Center, which will provide close, hands-on engagement with game platforms. Possible objects of study include the Atari 2600 (1977), ColecoVision (1982), Sega Game Gear (1990) and Genesis/CD/32X (1988-94), Panasonic 3DO (1993), Nintendo 64 (1996) and Wii (2006), and PlayStation 4/VR (2013-16).",Spring,"CMST 37880, MAPH 37880, MADD 17880",Instructor consent required.,Christopher Carloy
CMST 27887,The Platformer: History and Theory of a Videogame Genre. 100 Units.,"This course will provide an introduction to genre history and theory in videogame studies through a focus on the ""platformer."" Though not a common name outside of videogame culture, the platformer has introduced or popularized some of the medium's most recognizable figures (Mario, Sonic the Hedgehog, Donkey Kong) and gameplay mechanics (running, jumping, avoiding enemies, and collecting items). The genre has also been instrumental in and reflective of changes across the videogame medium. This course will cover two decades (roughly 1990 - 2010), emphasizing both historical details and theoretical questions, such as: How have game genres been defined? How do distinct genres emerge and change over time? How do broader trends (technological, formal, industrial, discursive, experiential, etc.) influence individual genres, and what roles do individual genres play in these broader trends? What resources and methodologies exist for studying videogame genres? Throughout the course we'll see the platformer alternate between an emphasis on linear, acrobatic movement across two-dimensional spaces and the free exploration of three-dimensional virtual worlds; between providing mascots for the biggest game companies and becoming a marker of independent, small-team production; and between being hailed as ""revolutionary"" and epitomizing the retro-nostalgic. Classroom lecture and discussion of readings will be accompanied by weekly gameplay sessions on original hardware at the MADD Center.",Winter,"MAPH 37887, CMST 37887, MADD 17887",Instructor consent required,Christopher Carloy

Students in this production-based class will examine the techniques and opportunities of this new kind of moving image. During this class we'll study the construction of examples across a gamut from locative media, journalism, and gameplay-based works to museum installations. Students will complete a series of critical essays and sketches towards a final augmented reality project using a custom set of software tools developed in and for the class.",Autumn,"ARTV 37921, ARTV 27921, MADD 22911, CMST 37911",,Marc Downie
CMST 27916,Critical Videogame Studies. 100 Units.,"Since the 1960s, games have arguably blossomed into the world's most profitable and experimental medium. This course attends specifically to video games, including popular arcade and console games, experimental art games, and educational serious games. Students will analyze both the formal properties and sociopolitical dynamics of video games. Readings by theorists such as Ian Bogost, Roger Caillois, Alenda Chang, Nick Dyer‐Witheford, Mary Flanagan, Jane McGonigal, Soraya Murray, Lisa Nakamura, Amanda Phillips, and Trea Andrea Russworm will help us think about the growing field of video game studies. Students will have opportunities to learn about game analysis and apply these lessons to a collaborative game design project. Students need not be technologically gifted or savvy, but a wide-ranging imagination and interest in digital media or game cultures will make for a more exciting quarter. This is a 2021-22 Signature Course in the College. (Literary/Critical Theory)",Autumn,"MADD 12320, ENGL 12320, SIGN 26038, GNSE 22320",,Patrick Jagoda
CMST 27920,Virtual Reality Production. 100 Units.,"Focusing on experimental moving-image approaches at a crucial moment in the emerging medium of virtual reality, this class will explore and interrogate each stage of production for VR. By hacking their way around the barriers and conventions of current software and hardware to create new optical experiences, students will design, construct and deploy new ways of capturing the world with cameras and develop new strategies and interactive logics for placing images into virtual spaces. Underpinning these explorations will be a careful discussion, dissection and reconstruction of techniques found in the emerging VR ""canon"" that spans new modes of journalism and documentary, computer games, and narrative ""VR cinema."" Film production and computer programming experience is welcome but not a prerequisite for the course. Students will be expected to complete short ""sketches"" of approaches in VR towards a final short VR experience.",Winter,"CMST 37920, ARTV 37920, ARTV 27920, MADD 24920",,Marc Downie
CMST 27931,Re-imagning Health in Immersive Media Environments. 100 Units.,"Virtual Reality (VR) as a storytelling medium is often discussed in terms of immersion and presence and how these media specificities tend to instill greater empathy. The common argument suggests that VR allows participants to experience someone else's lived reality as if it were their own. This capacity of VR to increase empathy has been contested by scholars in various fields. In light of this critique, we will examine the potential of VR to tell stories of illness and debility beyond empathy. Using concepts from critical disability studies, phenomenology, narrative medicine, and media theory, we will learn to distinguish the roles that VR narratives offer their participants, ranging from being a witness to becoming the first-person experiencer of non-normative embodiments. Exemplary questions are: what are the limitations of empathy in VR illness narratives? How can illness narratives in VR critically reflect on binaries between healthy/ill? Each week, we will focus on particular health issues as they are taken up by VR artists. We will delve into the ways VR enables experiences of pain in the absence of tissue damage or offer multisensory and nonlinear stories to give a sense of the ups and downs of living with bipolar disorder. The literature provided will help guide us through the exploration of these VR experiences. We will also try out some of these VR experiences ourselves.",Spring,"MADD 24931, CMST 37931",,Desiree Foerster
CMST 28103,Popular Music on Film. 100 Units.,"The rockumentary, concert, or popular music film remains an enduring object across the 20th and 21st centuries. From Bob Dylan's Don't Look Back to Wattstax to Taylor Swift: The Era's Tour, these films stage an essential encounter between two key forms of mass media: popular music and cinema. Starting with this relationship, this class asks, ""What can popular music and cinema teach us about each other?"" Across readings borrowed from cultural studies, music, and cinema-in addition to weekly film screenings-this course will help students develop a robust understanding of the common ground the popular music film constructs. We will explore how this genre exposes a network of concepts relating to media technology, race, and music culture through close reading and focused film analysis. While this class expects participants to have a basic awareness of the language of film analysis, this class does not assume its students to have formal musical training. Instead, this course encourages and teaches to develop basic skills in competently writing about music on film from a cultural studies perspective. Beginning with common theoretical and cultural concerns shared between film and music, we will learn to describe on-screen music and sound using focused, meaningful, and accurate language. As an extension of this project, we will also learn approaches to incorporating discussions of media culture that reflect and embrace an enduring legacy of popular writing on music.",Winter,,,Joel Sutherland
CMST 28205,Feminist Documentary Filmmaking. 100 Units.,"This course examines the ways that women-identifying documentary makers have given cinematic form to feminist thought. Drawing from film and media theory and history, we will focus on the formal and narrative techniques that have been employed by filmmakers to reflect on questions pertaining to gender and sexuality, with an emphasis on the specific ways that non-fiction filmmaking expanded feminist theoretical frameworks and research methodologies. Considering topics such as cinematic realism, film spectatorship, viewing pleasure, counter-cinema, and theories of intersectionality and diaspora, we will ask questions such as: What are the stylistic devices that feminist documentary films have mobilized, and for what purposes and ends? What is documentary's relation to the history of fiction film, particularly of Hollywood cinema? How have women documentary makers understood cinema's role in social processes of transformation? What are the possibilities and limitations of collaborative methods, appropriation strategies, and oppositional techniques? We will watch films with a critical eye and engage closely with academic and popular writings to survey the aesthetic, social, and political genealogies operating in the history of feminist documentary production. In this discussion-based course, we will cover a variety of non-fiction film and media forms: film diaries, docu-fictions, home-movies, video essays, auto-ethnographies, ethno-fictions, collage, and found-footage films.",Spring,"GNSE 23164, MADD 18205",,Cinta Peleja
CMST 28360,Screendance: Movement and New Media. 100 Units.,"This course will explore the evolving relationship between moving bodies and video technologies. From early filmmakers using dancers as test subjects, to movie musicals and contemporary dance for the camera festivals, mediatization of the body continues to challenge the ephemerality of live dance performance. This course focuses on the growing field of screendance, videodance, or dance-on-camera, working to define this hybrid genre and to understand the collaborative roles of choreographer, director, dancer, cameraman, and video editor. This course is both a practical and scholarly approach to the genre of screendance, each component essential to a full understanding and mastery of the other. Course work will be divided between the studio and the classroom. For the studio component, students will learn basic video editing and filming techniques. For the classroom component, students will be asked to watch screendance and read a cross-section of criticism. Assignments will be both technological and choreographic (making screendance) and scholarly (written reflections and a seminar paper).",Autumn,"TAPS 28360, MADD 23860, TAPS 38360",,L. Leopold

CMST 28700,"History of International Cinema, Part III: 1960 to Present. 100 Units.","This course will continue the study of cinema around the world from the 1960s to the 2000s. The continued development of film style and form over this period - one of seismic changes in audio-visual aesthetics - will be one of the primary themes of the course. Additionally, lectures and discussions will wrestle with the rise of global film cultures, technological innovations and their effects on style (such as post-magnetic sound, and visual effects techniques), major international directors and the solidification of auteurism as both a commercial and aesthetic imperative, the increasing internationalization of Hollywood, and post-1970s genre reorientation elevating horror, science-fiction, and other genres to the highest levels of mainstream respectability, critical appraisal, and/or commercial success. Screenings are mandatory and include work by filmmakers including Pedro Almodovar, Michael Bay, Kathryn Bigelow, Claire Denis, Federico Fellini, Hollis Frampton, Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Djibril Diop Mambety, Cristian Mungiu, and more, in addition to a selection of music videos.",Spring,"CMST 38700, MADD 18700",,Clint Froehlich
CMST 28805,Politics and Cinema under Authority. 100 Units.,"Why do authoritarian regimes take interest in art and culture? How do citizens respond to these efforts? Between authoritarian propaganda and outright contestation of authoritarianism is a wide niche of art and media production that is just independent enough to capture the attention of the citizens and yet subtle enough to not alarm authoritarian rulers. This is relevant for film and television in particular, which cannot function under authoritarian regimes without official approval. In this course, we explore the compromises filmmakers make to continue their creative practice and the concessions state actors grant to accommodate artistic work using the 10-episode television series, Dekalog (1988), by the acclaimed Polish director Krzysztof Kieślowski. To answer our questions, we draw on literature and methodology from political science and film and media studies. We investigate what is to be gained by combining approaches from two disciplines that are rarely in conversation with each other.",Autumn,"CDIN 28801, REES 28800, REES 38800, PLSC 38801, PLSC 28805, CMST 38800, CDIN 38800",,Maria Belodubrovskaya and Monika Nalepa
CMST 28906,Contemporary Cinematic Special Effects. 100 Units.,"The highest-grossing films of the twenty-first century are, without exception, showcases for special effects. How did special effects become so central to mass-audience movies? What are the consequences of this shift? In this course, we will track the historical and stylistic development of contemporary effects-driven filmmaking, bridging practitioner discourse by effects industry workers with the theories of cinema and media scholars. While our screenings will primarily comprise narrative feature films, we will also explore how special effects draw upon diverse media forms and practices, including experimental cinema, installation art, amusement parks, television advertising, and, above all, digital technologies. Screenings will include Hollywood blockbusters (e.g., The Matrix [1999]), ""failed"" blockbusters (e.g., Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within [2001]), and effects-driven films from other national/regional cinemas (e.g., The Mermaid [China, 2016]).",Winter,MADD 10906,,Cooper Long
CMST 28910,Planetary Media. 100 Units.,"This course is about how planets are imagined through media as environmental and social systems, with a focus on exchanges between science fictional ""world building"" practices and scientific ways of knowing. We study the history of science fiction and science borrowing from one another to explain how Earth and other planets work, and how both fields have used media to depict planets. When science fiction creates imaginary worlds, are its tools similar or different to those used by exoplanet astronomers or Mars rover teams? How do these shared planetary imaginaries affect the public's understanding of the climate crisis? Examples will be drawn from both fiction and nonfiction, and both technical and aesthetic media, including climate models, video games, television, pulp magazines, and film. The course culminates with a creative, group planetary world building assignment.",Autumn,MADD 12980,,Katherine Buse

CMST 28921,Introduction to 16mm Filmmaking. 100 Units.,"The goal of this intensive laboratory course is to give its students a working knowledge of film production using the 16mm gauge. The course will emphasize how students can use 16mm technology towards successful cinematography and image design (for use in both analog and digital postproduction scenarios) and how to develop their ideas towards constructing meaning through moving pictures. Through a series of group exercises, students will put their hands on equipment and solve technical and aesthetic problems, learning to operate and care for the 16mm Bolex film camera; prime lenses; Sekonic light meter; Sachtler tripod; and Arri light kit and accessories. For a final project, students will plan and produce footage for an individual or small group short film. The first half the course will be highly structured, with demonstrations, in-class shoots, and lectures.

CMST 28925,Expanded Cinema. 100 Units.,"Though often overlooked, the act of projection is at the heart of cinema (the act or process of causing a picture to appear on a surface). This studio course focuses on the creation of moving image-based work, exploring how time and space are used as materials to create form and inspire content within the contemporary film genre known as expanded cinema. The technical, historical and political aspects of the projected image will be studied in order to re-think cinema as a group and investigate how the projected image can find meaning outside the black box of theaters or the white cube of galleries. Two personal experimental video projects will lead to a third final collective video installation that will use the environment within the vicinity of UChicago's campus to inspire the work while also become the location of the final outdoor projection event.

Does the same thing happen to everyone after death, or is there some form of postmortem reward and punishment? If heaven exists, what is heaven like? How do beliefs about life after death influence behavior in this life? This course engages with these questions as we explore the development and diversity of afterlife beliefs in Judaism and Christianity, from antiquity to the present day. We will pay special attention to the various functions of afterlife beliefs at different points in history, including in our contemporary society. Is Marx correct that belief in heaven and eternal life legitimizes the social order and contributes to oppression on earth? Conversely, does the idea of postmortem rewards and punishments actually contribute to a more just society by motivating individuals to strive to live virtuously? By the end of the course, students will not only be familiar with Jewish and Christian conceptions of the afterlife, but also conversant in perspectives on postmortem existence found in classical philosophy that continue to inform how we think about death in the contemporary world.

The later Roman emperors established the most intensive, pervasive state structures of the ancient Mediterranean, yet yielded their northern and western territories to Goths, Huns, Vandals, and, ultimately, their Middle Eastern core to the Arab Muslims. Imperial Christianity united the populations of the Roman Mediterranean in the service of one God, but simultaneously divided them into competing sectarian factions. A novel culture of Christian asceticism coexisted with the consolidation of an aristocratic ruling class notable for its insatiable appetite for gold.

We will discuss the societal dynamics and generic norms through which those characters emerge and we will explore their intertextual journey through myth and literature, ancient and modern. Key questions of the course include: What makes a woman evil? How is the evil female constructed through the writing, visuals, and performance of tragedy? What does it mean to present an evil female in a genre where all writers and actors are male? To what extent does tragedy shape and reflect the patriarchal structures of the Athenian society?

CLCV 21922,Broken Mirrors: Writing the Other from Herodotus to the Jewish/Christian. 100 Units.,"How are Others represented in Greco-Roman, Jewish, and Christian canons? Is the Other purely a mirror of the self who represents it? Or do self and Other interact? Can we trace and compare patterns of representation and taxonomies for human difference across cultures, genres, regions, periods, and sciences? How can we develop new critical frameworks and concepts for this task, if we refuse to take for granted the categories and conventions of today's academic disciplines? What might this new approach to the Other help us to learn, or unlearn, about the making of ""the West""? In order to answer those questions, our course will survey the most influential literary models of the Other, from Herodotus to the early medieval ""Life of Jesus"" polemic tradition. Beyond developing a new framework for exploring and connecting these diverse sources, it has three historical aims. First, to interrogate the limits of modern anthropology as the institutionalized site for writing and knowing the Other. Second, to reveal the centrality of the figure of the Jew in the prehistory of anthropology, where it plays a neglected but crucial role in the European history of human difference in general. Finally, to expose the premodern roots of ""scientific"" categories-""primitive,"" ""civilized,"" ""Oriental,"" ""Aryan,"" ""Semite,"" etc.-where racial, linguistic, religious, and cultural differences still intersect today.",Spring,"HREL 37652, RLST 27652, CMLT 37652, CLAS 31922, JWSC 26603, HIJD 37652",,James Adam Redfield

It did this until 1453, when it became the capital of the emerging Ottoman empire, a function that it served until 1922. No city in history has, for so long, served continually as the capital of two successive empires that, in their various incarnations, stradled Europe, Asia, and Africa and played a major role in shaping global politics and world culture. In this course, students will learn about these two parallel histories and cultures through a series of paired thematic units: Foundations; Imperial Cultures; Religious Cultures; and Hagia Sophia (a monument that continues to be a flashpoint for competing claims to the past and modern identities). One week in the middle will be devoted to Transitions, namely to the period around the siege of 1453, before which many Turks lived under east Roman rule and after which most Romans (Greeks) lived under Ottoman rule. The instructors will foster creative dialogue between these two cultures by focusing, in each unit, on exemplary monuments and primary written sources.

Vandals, Arabs, Goths, Huns, Franks, and Iranians, among numerous others, took shape as political communities within the Roman and Iranian empires or along their peripheries. Recent scholarship has undone the traditional image of these groups as previously undocumented communities of ""barbarians"" entering history. Ethnic communities emerge from the literature as political constructions dependent on the very malleability of identities, on specific acts of textual and artistic production, on particular religious traditions, and, not least, on the imperial or postimperial regimes sustaining their claims to sovereignty. The colloquium will debate the origin, nature, and roles of ethno-political identities and communities comparatively across West Asia, from the Western Mediterranean to the Eurasian steppes, on the basis of recent contributions. As a historiographical colloquium, the course will address the contemporary cultural and political concerns-especially nationalism-that have often shaped historical accounts of ethnogenesis in the period as well as bio-historical approaches-such as genetic history-that sometimes sit uneasily with the recent advances of historians.",Spring,"MDVL 20902, CLAS 33718, NEHC 30802, HIST 30902, NEHC 20802, HIST 20902",Open to advanced undergraduates and graduate students.,R.

In this course, we will take a historical and philosophical approach to examine the relations between pain, truth, and justice. In the premodern period, we will draw from Genesis, Sophocles' Oedipus, Augustine, Tertullian, martyrdom accounts, and public penance in medieval Christianity. To study the theme in the early modern nation-state spectacles of punishment, colonial contexts, and contemporary scenes of justice, we will turn to the writings of Foucault, Fanon, and others. Over the course of the historical and philosophical examinations, we will trace the themes of body, affect, and performance; truth, law, and ritual; power, religion, and the nation-state.

Should we hope for a better future, focus our energies on making peace with the present, or attempt to do both? How do we cultivate joy in the midst of adversity? Can pain be productive? The literature of ancient consolation engages these questions as it bears witness to the myriad ways in which ancient Greeks, Romans, Jews, and Christians attempted to comfort suffering people. The goal was not simply to defeat grief, but to replace grief with its opposite, joy. This course introduces students to ancient consolation literature, a genre composed of various literary forms (e.g., funeral orations, consolatory letters, apocalypses, prophecies) but united by a common store of vocabulary, expressions of sympathy, arguments against grief, and exhortations to admirable behavior amid hardship. We will read selections from Cicero, Seneca, Plutarch, the Bible, and various texts of early Judaism and Christianity. At the end of the course, we will bridge the horizons between ancient approaches to consolation and current debates about how to treat grief and facilitate human flourishing during hardship.

It is generally accepted that the way speakers chose to describe something reveals their stance toward truth as well as their rhetorical intention about the message. This affective (Giannakidou and Mari 2021) use follows from the communicative function of language: successful communication requires maximum efficiency, and as speakers choose their words, audiences recognize the intentions behind them and form veridicality judgments (i.e., judgments about the truth or not of the content conveyed, its reliability, and the like). Veridicality judgments are based on knowledge, beliefs, experiences, and ideology (i.e., a set of fixed and non-negotiable beliefs). Non-negotiable beliefs can distort the veridicality judgment and potentially damage, intentionally or unintentionally, the relation to truth. The class includes some classical readings from Plato's Cratylus, Gorgias and Aristotle's Rhetoric, as well as more contemporary readings (Giannakidou and Mari 2021, A linguistic framework for knowledge, belief and veridicality judgment, and the phenomenon of concept creep (Haslam2016) where meaning is extended in warranted or unwarranted ways to manipulate emotion.",Autumn,"LING 28810, LING 38810, KNOW 28810, CLAS 33824",,Anastasia Giannakidou

Our goal will be to read Thucydides' account in its political and cultural context in order to understand both the text and the event that have proved foundational to the western tradition of thinking on democracy, empire, and particularly international relations. Among the questions we will discuss: How did the Athenians' democratic politics and culture influence the course of the war? How did the pursuit of empire influence their practice of democracy?

Throughout the course students will learn to navigate the pitfalls and opportunities the study of gender affords for understanding the development of biblical interpretation, the transformation of classical Graeco-Roman culture, and the formation of Christian doctrine. How did Christianity challenge and preserve norms for female behavior? How did Rabbinic and early Christian authors approach questions of sexuality differently? Along the way we will bring 20th-century theorists of sexuality and gender into our conversations to illuminate pre-modern discourses of virginity, sexual experience, and identity.

CLCV 25521,The Sublime. 100 Units.,"The sublime has traditionally been thought to have had a merely marginal place in ancient Greek and Latin aesthetics and literary theory; but some scholars have recently argued that it was instead more central, and it is difficult not to apply this category to many ancient literary works. However the explicit category of the sublime did not become central to European aesthetics until the 17th century and then continued until the 19th century to play a central role in discussions not only of art and literature, but also of religion, politics, and other fields. By the middle of the 19th century the wave of interest in the sublime seems to have subsided, but in the past forty years this concept has returned to play an important role in aesthetic theories. The seminar will consider the odd history of the sublime, examining central texts from ancient (Longinus), early modern (Boileau), and modern aesthetics (certainly Burke, Kant, Schiller, and Hegel; perhaps also, depending on students' interest and preparation, Tieck, Schlegel, Schelling, Solger, and Jean Paul) as well as some more recent discussions (again depending on student preferences, Nietzsche, Lyotard, Adorno, Zizek).

Machiavelli's Mandragola dramatizes the tricks by which young Callimaco manages with the aid of the trickster parasite Ligurio to have sex with Lucrezia, the beautiful young wife of the elderly lawyer Nicomaco, with the consent of both her and her husband, ushering in a new regime in which all are satisfied. In Shakespeare's Measure for Measure Angelo the interim duke of Vienna institutes a repressive sexual regime in which the brothels are closed and extramarital sex is a capital crime. What might we learn about sexual relations from these diverse plays? Why are they comedies?",Spring.

Along with war comes the concept of peace, both in life and in poetry. In this course, we will use poetry and poetic texts to explore different possibilities for understanding the fundamental tension that exists between the quasi-universal notion that ""no one is so foolish as to choose war over peace"" (Herodotus, 1.87), and the fact that war has been our constant companion. Along the way, we will examine how poets across a spectrum of cultures, eras, and genres have given life to rich expressions of hope, fear, and everything in between, and ask ourselves how these poets succeed in illuminating these parts of the human experience, and to what effect. Homer and Vergil will be our guides through the first part of the quarter, but in the second half we will explore poetries of war and peace from around the world, up to the present.",Spring,CLAS 38024,,Jonah Radding

In this course, we will explore the ancient interpretation of myth from the archaic Greek to the Roman periods. First, we will focus on the cross-cultural adaptations of Near Eastern traditions in Greek epic (Homer and Hesiod), as a form of interpretation itself. Then we will discuss how ancient poets and thinkers interpreted and reinterpreted divine narratives, paying attention to their philosophical, literary, and cultural strategies, from Orphism and Plato to the Stoics and later philosophical schools, including Euhemerism and its engagement with Phoenician mythology.",Spring,"NEHC 38499, RLST 28499, CLAS 38422, HREL 38499, NEHC 28499",,Carolina López-Ruiz

As a city of diverse populations, Thessaloniki constituted a melting pot of cultures and a hub for economic activities for a major part of its history. The course will be discussion-based and bring into dialogue textual and material evidence that illustrates various topics of the history of Thessaloniki. Among those topics, we will examine Thessaloniki's foundation, its relationship with other cities in the Hellenistic world, the formation of (ethnic) identity in Macedonia, its Christianization, its archaeological landscape, the multicultural civic identity and the construction of other (Greek, Jewish, Roman, Slavic, Ottoman), immigration movements, economy and commerce. We will explore a spectrum of historical themes, but our focus will range: We will delve into the intricate stories of personalities, monuments, and objects. Yet, our ultimate aim will be to step back and analyze broader phenomena in their longue durée.",Autumn,"CLAS 38524, ANCM 38524",,Georgios Tsolakis

GREK 24714,Aeschylus' Oresteia: drama and democracy. 100 Units.,"Ancient Greek drama in the 5th c. BCE both maps and reckons with the constitutive tensions in the polis between residual (but still influential) aristocratic norms and practices and the newly dominant (but still evolving) democratic ethos and ideals- its practices institutionalized in the assembly, the magistracies, and the courts. Aeschylus's Oresteia represents and contributes to that debate, as it explores (among other things) the fortunes of the house of Atreus, the making of the polis, gender trouble, questions of kinship, revenge and its impasses, institutions of justice. This trilogy helps us understand crucial aspects of the society that produced it and also invites us to reflect on the ways ancient literature informs how we think about ourselves and our predicaments now-political, familial, and existential. And the Oresteia further invites us to think about the uses and possibilities of theater, then and now.

We can see these well by reading the narrative text The Acts of Paul and Thecla alongside the ""Pastoral Epistles"" (1 and 2 Timothy, Titus), the former championing a female, cross-dressing ascetic Christ-missionary and the latter, in pseudepigraphical epistolary texts written in the dead Paul's name, insisting on patriarchal family life and women's adherence to traditional roles. In this course we shall read both sets of texts carefully in Greek, noting points of similarity and contestation, and test various models of how these sources-each of which seeks to ""fix"" the Pauline legacy in its own way-are related to one another. Time allowing, we shall also look at the later reception of the cult of Saint Thecla and late antique interpretations of ""the apostle,"" Paul, on these issues of sexuality and gender roles, and their perduring influence in contemporary debates.",Autumn,"HCHR 42035, GNSE 42035, FNDL 22035, GREK 37423, GNSE 22035, BIBL 42035, RLST 22035","At least one year of Greek, or equivalent.",Margaret Mitchell

Through both lectures and discussions, we will examine the scientific and practical applications and limitations of LLMs across diverse domains and contemplate the future prospects and challenges LLMs pose for science, technology, and society. Through critical discourse, hands-on exercises, and case studies, our goal is to foster a comprehensive understanding of LLMs, empowering students to critically assess these models and contribute to ongoing dialogues regarding their broader implications. Prior experience in computer science or cognitive science is beneficial but not mandatory. Note: this course primarily focuses on cultivating reflective thinking about LLMs, rather than programming or implementation. Students with programming skills are, however, encouraged to utilize them to facilitate their learning.",Autumn,LING 20110,,Eugene Yu Ji
COGS 22000,Introduction to Linguistics. 100 Units.,"This course offers a brief survey of how linguists analyze the structure and the use of language. Looking at the structure of language means understanding what phonemes, words, and sentences are, and how each language establishes principles for the combinations of these things and for their use; looking at the use of language means understanding the ways in which individuals and groups use language to declare their social identities and the ways in which languages can change over time. The overarching theme is understanding what varieties of language structure and use are found across the world's languages and cultures, and what limitations on this variety exist.",Autumn,LING 20001,,"2022-2023: Erik Zyman (Autumn), Jacob Phillips (Winter), Laura Stigliano (Spring)"

The first half of the course focuses on how speech sounds are described with respect to their articulatory, acoustic, and perceptual structures. There are lab exercises both in phonetic transcription and in the acoustic analysis of speech sounds. The second half focuses on fundamental notions that have always been central to phonological analysis and that transcend differences between theoretical approaches: contrast, neutralization, natural classes, distinctive features, and basic phonological processes (e.g., assimilation).",Spring,LING 20101,LING 20001,2022-2023: Jason Riggle (Spring)
COGS 22002,Language and Communication. 100 Units.,"This course can also be taken by students who are not majoring in Linguistics but are interested in learning something about the uniqueness of human language, spoken or signed. It covers a selection from the following topics: What is the position of spoken language in the usually multimodal forms of communication among humans? In what ways does spoken language differ from signed language? What features make spoken and signed language linguistic? What features distinguish linguistic means of communication from animal communication? How do humans communicate with animals? From an evolutionary point of view, how can we account for the fact that spoken language is the dominant mode of communication in all human communities around the world? Why cannot animals really communicate linguistically? What do the terms language ""acquisition"" and ""transmission"" really mean? What factors account for differences between ""language acquisition"" by children and by adults? Are children really perfect language learners? What factors bring about language evolution, including language speciation and the emergence of new language varieties? How did language evolve in mankind?

One prevailing hypothesis is that the human mind can take advantage of this predictability to help maintain the rapid pace of language comprehension. This course will explore critical questions surrounding the nature of prediction processes during language comprehension. What do people predict? How are their predictions constrained? How can we study the inherently internal process(es) of prediction? What are the consequences of prediction?

In this discussion-based seminar, we will consider schools as battlegrounds in the US ""culture wars"": contests over competing visions of national identity, morality, social order, the fundamental purposes of public education, and the role of the state vis-à-vis the family. Drawing on case studies from history, anthropology, sociology and critical race and gender studies, we will examine both past and contemporary debates over school curriculum and school policy. Topics may include clashes over: the teaching of evolution, sex and sexuality education, busing/desegregation, prayer in schools, multiculturalism, the content of the literary canon, the teaching of reading, mathematics and history, and the closure of underperforming urban schools.

CHDV 23511,"Memory, Reconciliation, and Healing: Transitional Justice. 100 Units.","Across the globe, recent national attempts to transition out of authoritarian rule and to manage the legacies of political conflicts have invoked discourses and questions of human rights. In the last fifty years, millions of people across the world have experience periods of protest and mobilization, violence and genocide, the emergence and entrenchment of armed revolutionary forces, and repressive governments. As these periods came to an end, the governments, civil societies, and individual citizens in each country have had to face the challenges of rebuilding social fabric, trust, and democratic culture while memorializing the past and considering the root causes of past conflict and authoritarianism. These processes have include discourses of rights (e.g. transitional justice, but also participation, democracy, education, etc.) and have shaped the lives of millions of individuals in these countries as well as the trajectories of each nation and its governments. The proposed course draws on Peru, South Africa, and Ireland as case studies to guide students in comparatively analyzing the transitional processes and current implications. The goal of the course is for students to explore how these societies and their citizens have sought to deal with these problematic national histories and what ways these processes continue to influence each society. The students will leave the class with a better understanding of how conflict and post-conflict issues and developments.",,"HMRT 23511, LACS 23511",,
CHDV 24050,Understanding Practical Wisdom. 100 Units.,"Thinking about the nature of wisdom goes back to the Greek philosophers and the classical religious sages, but the concept of wisdom has changed in many ways over the history of thought. While wisdom has received less scholarly attention in modern times, it has recently re-emerged in popular discourse with a growing recognition of its potential importance for addressing complex issues in many domains. But what is wisdom? It's often used with a meaning more akin to ""smart"" or ""clever."" Is it just vast knowledge? This course will examine the nature of wisdom-how it has been defined in philosophy and psychological science, how its meaning has changed, and what its essential components might be. We will discuss how current philosophical and psychological theories conceptualize wisdom and consider whether, and how, wisdom can be studied scientifically; that is, can wisdom be measured and experimentally manipulated to illuminate its underlying mechanisms and understand its functions? Finally, we will explore how concepts of wisdom can be applied in business, education, medicine, the law, and in the course of our everyday lives. Readings will be drawn from a wide array of disciplines. The course will include lectures by philosophers and psychologists. This course is offered in association with the Chicago Moral Philosophy Project and the Good Life program (the Hyde Park Institute).

The focus will be on racial gaps in urban health inequality with some discussion of rural communities. Readings will largely cover the research on Black and White gaps in health inequality, with the understanding that most of the issues discussed extend to health inequalities across many racial and ethnic groups. Readings cover the broad range of social determinants of health (socioeconomic status, education, access to health care, homelessness) and how these social determinants are rooted in longstanding legacies of American inequality.

We will situate creoles in the context of the plantation settlement colonies that produced them and compare their emergence specifically with that of languages such as English and the Romance languages in Europe. We will also compare these evolutions with those of new colonial varieties of European languages (such as Amish English, mainstream American English varieties, Brazilian Portuguese, and Québécois French) which emerged around the same time but are not considered creoles. Using the comparative approach (in evolutionary theory), we will assess whether the criteria used in the genetic classification of languages have been applied uniformly to creole and non-creole languages. In return, we will explore ways in which genetic creolistics can inform and improve genetic linguistics (including historical dialectology).",,"LING 24960, RDIN 34960, RDIN 24960, CHDV 34960, LING 34960",,Salikoko Mufwene

This class engages lay, scholarly and fictional futurisms-particularly emerging from Queer, Indigenous and Black traditions. We will read sociological and anthropological texts that consider how different communities envision the decades and centuries to come alongside speculative fiction that theorizes where earth and humanity are heading.

CHDV 25120,Child Development and Public Policy. 100 Units.,"The goal of this course is to introduce students to the literature on early child development and explore how an understanding of core developmental concepts can inform social policies. This goal will be addressed through an integrated, multidisciplinary approach. The course will emphasize research on the science of early child development from the prenatal period through school entry. The central debate about the role of early experience in development will provide a unifying strand for the course. Students will be introduced to research in neuroscience, psychology, economics, sociology, and public policy as it bears on questions about ""what develops?"", critical periods in development, the nature vs. nurture debate, and the ways in which environmental contexts (e.g., parents, families, peers, schools, institutions, communities) affect early development and developmental trajectories. The first part of the course will introduce students to the major disciplinary streams in the developmental sciences and the enduring and new debates and perspectives within the field. The second part will examine the multiple contexts of early development to understand which aspects of young children's environments affect their development and how those impacts arise. Throughout the course, we will explore how the principles of early childhood development can guide the design of policies and practices that enhance the healthy development of young children, particularly for those living in adverse circumstances, and thereby build a strong foundation for promoting equality of opportunity, reducing social class disparities in life outcomes, building human capital, fostering economic prosperity, and generating positive social change. In doing so, we will critically examine the evidence on whether the contexts of children's development are amenable to public policy intervention and the costs and benefits of different policy approaches.",Autumn,"PSYC 25120, PBPL 25120, EDSO 25120",Attendance on the first day of class is required or registration will be dropped.,A.

However, measurement of phenomena that are not directly observable (such as psychological attributes, perceptions of organizational climate, or quality of services) is difficult. Much of the research in psychometrics has been developed in an attempt to properly define and quantify such phenomena. This course is designed to introduce students to the relevant concepts, principles, and methods underlying the construction and interpretation of tests or measures. It provides in-depth coverage of test reliability and validity, topics in test theory, and statistical procedures applicable to psychometric methods. Such understanding is essential for rigorous practice in measurement as well as for proper interpretation of research.

They will be trained to read critically the evolution of political discourse on citizenship in the United States since the American Revolution. They will learn to detect the role of shifting interpretations of race and ethnicity, after that of European nationality, in determining who is (not) a (full) citizen. For instance, who counted as ""American"" in the early stages of the Republic? Why were Native Americans and (descendants of) forced immigrants from Africa excluded at the outset? How did English become the unofficial language of American citizenship and inclusion?

CHDV 27015,Scientific and Humanistic Contributions to Knowledge Formation. 100 Units.,"In this course, we will explore whether the sciences and the humanities can make complementary contributions to the formation of knowledge, thus leading to the integration and unification of human knowledge. In the first part of the course we will take a historical approach to the issue; we will discuss how art and science were considered complementary for much of the 18th and 19th century (for example, in the views and work of Wolfgang Goethe), how they became separate ('the two cultures') in the middle of the 20th century with the compartmentalization of academic disciplines, and how some attempts have recently been made at a reunification under the concept of 'consilience'. In the second part of the course, we will focus on conceptual issues such as the cognitive value of literature, the role of ideas in knowledge formation in science and literature, the role of creativity in scientific and literary production, and how scientific and philosophical ideas have been incorporated into literary fiction in the genre known as 'the novel of ideas'. As an example of the latter, we will read the novel 'One, No One, and 100,000' (1926) by Luigi Pirandello and discuss how this author elaborated and articulated a view of the human persona (including issues of identity and personality) from French philosophers and psychologists such as Henri Bergson and Alfred Binet.",Winter,"SCTH 47015, CHDV 47015, KNOW 28015, HIPS 27515, CHSS 47015, KNOW 47015",,D.

Further, many in society overlook or are unaware of the critical contributions Black psychologists have made in shaping federal policies many Americans benefit from today. In response to these concerns, this course will introduce students to relevant psychological scholarship by drawing from both historical and current arguments that center questions of identity development, wellbeing, goodness, and cultural strengths already present within Black communities. The goals of this course are to examine factors that inform the racialized lived experiences of Black Americans across the lifecourse, while also interrogating the structural forces that impede quality of life and other key health-related outcomes overtime.",,"RDIN 27501, PSYC 27350, SSAD 27500",,

Some novelists in the late 19th and early 20th century provided fictional portrayals of human nature that were grounded into Darwinian theory. These novelists operated within the conceptual framework of the complementarity of science and literature advanced by Goethe and the other romantics. At a time when novels became highly introspective and psychological, these writers used their literary craftsmanship to explore and illustrate universals aspects of human nature. In this course we read the work of several novelists such as George Eliot, HG Wells, Joseph Conrad, Jack London, Yuvgeny Zamyatin, Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, Italo Svevo, and Elias Canetti, and discuss how these authors anticipated the discoveries made decades later by cognitive, social, and evolutionary psychology.",Autumn,"CHSS 34921, HIST 34921, KNOW 31418, HIPS 24921, KNOW 21418, CHDV 37861, HIST 24921",,D.

In cultural, political, and educational spheres, disabilities are non-normative, marginal, even invisible. This runs counter to many of our lived experiences of difference where, in fact, disabilities of all kinds are the ""new normal."" In this interdisciplinary course, we center both the category and experience of disability. Moreover, we consider the stakes of explicitly designing for different kinds of bodies and minds. Rather than approaching disability as a problem to be accommodated, we consider the affordances that disability offers for design. This course begins by situating us in the growing discipline of Disability Studies and the activist (and intersectional) Disability Justice movement. We then move to four two-week units in specific areas where disability meets design: architecture, infrastructure, and public space; education and the classroom; economics, employment, and public policy; and aesthetics.

What, as a matter of fact, might spiritual sex mean for the cultivation of virtues like celibacy or virginity? While early Christianity and the Christian Middle Ages are often characterized by a disciplined asceticism, erotic desire was just as central to cultivating mystical love for God. In fact, the significance of the language of love, passion, loss, nuptial bliss, jubilation, and the body has rendered the Christian mystical tradition a useful resource for contemporary-and especially psychoanalytic-theories of sex, gender, and sexuality. This course will look both to the past and the present in order to explore the workings of pre- and postmodern desire and to draw connections between Christian mysticism and theories and practices of sex.

His intervention provoked a number of responses: some critiqued the critique, on empirical or theoretical grounds; some extended his analysis, which was based primarily on the Middle East, to other ""Orients""; some argued that his critique did not go far enough. We will examine Said's Orientalism, some important precursors in the critique of Orientalist knowledge, and a selection of responses to Said's work, with a focus on theoretical questions. Why do the overarching structures of knowledge change so slowly when it comes to the non-West, and why, at the same time, does ""knowledge"" about the non-West appear so compromised when we examine it a century or so after it is produced? What are the rules of the ""discursive formation"" Said claimed to have identified? On what basis can a critique of an entire ""way of knowing"" be justified and undertaken?

Though absent from most Bibles, there is an entire body of literature commonly known as ""rewritten bible"": early translations, retellings, or entirely new stories with familiar names and faces that update, retcon, or subvert their ""biblical"" sources. How might we understand these ancient forms of fan fiction? The class will introduce this corpus (including some of the Dead Sea Scrolls) and its sources, production, and historical contexts. We will confront significant problems in understanding religious texts: how is it that some texts become authoritative while other very similar texts do not? Who gets to retell foundational religious narratives, and within what social or political constraints? What does it mean to relate to sacred texts as artistic prompts or imperfect points of departure? Can a biblical text be rewritten for an entirely different religious tradition?

Reading American, European, and Israeli narratives, our discussions will focus on autobiographical and journalistic accounts of uprooting, immigration, conflict, and loss. We will ask: how do Jewish graphic novelists use the conventions and the grammar of this medium? How do they grapple with the proximity between caricature and comics, and with the legacy of racist caricatures? And what is the relationship between graphic narrative and memory culture?

We'll dive into their narrative poems on love: Galip's masnavi Love and Beauty breathes new life into rhyming couplets, and Robinson's ""Sappho and Phaeon"" contributes to the revival of the sonnet sequence, with both poets writing at historical crossroads. As the Ottoman Empire undertakes structural modernization efforts amidst decline, England expands its colonial outreach while contending with the legacies of the American and French Revolutions. We will analyze how these poets navigate the delicate balance between tradition and innovation, with a fundamental inquiry into their use of ornamentation and excess. Coleridge's quip, ""she overloads everything,"" nods to Robinson's affiliation with the ""Della Cruscans,"" while Galip's opulent works reflect the so-called ""Indian style."" What draws poets, or anyone, to such ornate expressive techniques? We'll ponder these questions, exploring their intersections with gendered, cultural, and political realms.

We will investigate how these authors renegotiate their identities, how they fashion national and political imaginaries, and how they envision alternative futures. Together, we will analyze source materials related to the themes of violence, memory, gender, and race. Through our weekly assignments and discussions, we will seek to determine the tropes and aesthetic tools that ignite modes of storytelling, and to answer: how do writers and artists employ aesthetic form to portray catastrophes? How might expressions of grief also be mobilized for resistance and struggle? Our class will be organized into three modules, touching upon African, Native American, and Palestinian prose, poetry, and film alongside theoretical works in memory and trauma studies.

The Evolution of the Detective Story. 100 Units.,"The course will analyze the rise and the development of the detective story from a (presumed) commercial genre to a literary one. We will focus in particular on the creative and essayistic works of the Italian writer Leonardo Sciascia (1921-1989). Enormously influential among contemporary Italian novelists, Sciascia has extensively reflected on the history of the detective novel, tracing its origins back to the Bible and examining different literary traditions, such as the American, French and Italian one. At the same time, in his creative works, Sciascia bends the rules of the genre and is therefore able to renew it. While examining Sciascia's works we will also analyze how and in which ways the detective novel served, on the one hand, to overcome Neorealism, and on the other to revive the role of the engaged intellectual in Italy.",,ITAL 25125,,
CMLT 21810,The Werewolf in Literature and Film. 100 Units.,"Human transformation into animals (and into wolves in particular) is a recurring trope in many cultures' storytelling. Authors have used the story device to explore the nature of humans and animals, human fear and vulnerability, psychological problems and mental illness, gender and sexuality, social/racial hierarchy, marginalization, identity, and our own capacity for violence and savagery. In this course we will examine werewolves in literature and film from several cultures (French, English, German, Finnish, Blackfoot, Japanese) in English translation, primarily from the late 20th century onward. We will focus on how the aforementioned themes are used and developed in each work and the overarching patterns of werewolf stories. Students will write a final analytical paper or produce a creative project.",Autumn,"ENGL 21810, GNSE 21810",,David Delbar
CMLT 21815,Strange Lit: Estrangement and Literature. 100 Units.,"This course explores the genre of the strange, weird, bizarre and wonderous in literary works from around the world and across various time periods. In contrast to the voyeuristic and expected othering of the 'exotic', the course interrogates the strange as an aesthetic mode that estranges the reader and disturbs and upends our familiar and predictable worlds. Theorists have explored art's ability to unsettle our automatized perception, interrogating our relationship to reality, the way we know things, and the basis on which we make assumptions. This course will trace how specific literary forms (like magical-realism, fantasy, sci-fi, miracle literature, comedy/dark comedy, and even scripture) evoke wonder and a sense of the strange. We will explore how these genres mystify and make strange things like the individual, society, modernity, the nation-state, the secular, economy, and more to unearth the myth-making inherent in processes of world-building, as well as in narrative. We will see ghosts in court, hallucinating nation-states, dead narrators, animated-inanimate objects as we move into the world of dreams, madness, and the supernatural in literary works from Iceland, Iran, Palestine, Japan, Egypt and more.",Autumn,"NEHC 21815, RLST 26815, CMLT 31815, ENGL 21815",,Rana Ghuloom
CMLT 21822,Creative Ecologies: Environmental and Multispecies Storytelling. 100 Units.,"Literature plays a pivotal role in addressing environmental issues: it can perpetuate damaging narratives or offer creative solutions for sustainable living. What is then the role of literature in an era of ecological crisis? How does literature forward environmental change? How do writers represent the natural world and imagine innovative ways of living ecologically? To answer these questions, we will turn to the field of ecocriticism informed by queer ecology, decolonial thought and critical animal studies. We will explore the themes of migration, extinction, displacement, hegemony, and biodiversity in texts of various genres, from poetry to speculative fiction, particularly in relation to imperial, colonial and capitalist ecologies. Besides questioning troublesome dichotomies within our corpus, such as domestic/wilderness and nature/culture, we will also examine the links between environmental concerns and gender, race, class, and species. While we will be attentive to the specificities of the Italian local environment to fully unravel the role of Italy in aggravating or lessening environmental problems, our approach will remain comparative and global in scope. We will also revisit the literary canon and privilege the stories of historically disenfranchised voices that narrativize ethical and sociopolitical issues related to ecology. The course will include visits to Special Collections and the Map Collection to further enrich our engagement with the literary sources.",,"ENST 21822, ITAL 21822",,Elizabeth Tavella

CMLT 22210,Decolonization and Culture. 100 Units.,"This course introduces students to the various theories of militant or ""fighting"" cultures engendered by global struggles for decolonization throughout the twentieth century. Beginning with the global upswell of revolutionary movements at the end of World War I, intellectuals and artists from the colonial world began to enlist poetry, novels, art, music and other cultural forms in the struggle for decolonization. At the same that culture was instrumentalized for larger political struggles, meanwhile, ""culture"" itself was increasingly understood as a distinct site of struggle: The decolonization of culture was part and parcel of the decolonization of peoples. This course traces this evolving global discourse linking culture and decolonization across the twentieth century, exploring how writers and activists from the colonial world articulated a new cultural agenda within the context of broader programs of social transformation. Throughout we will contend with key questions and dilemmas faced by culture producers in the age of decolonization: What is the role of artists in a revolution? How does culture serve as a staging-ground larger political and ideological conflicts? What are the promises and pitfalls of treating decolonization as a metaphor? To answer these and other related questions, we will draw on case studies from the Harlem Renaissance, the Proletarian Literature movement, Haitian and Latin American Indigenist movements, Négritude, and Third Worldism.",Spring,CRES 22210,,Noah Hansen
CMLT 22310,Character Study. 100 Units.,"This course offers space to consider in-depth one of the most fundamental, yet tricky aspects of stories: the imagined person, or fictional character. Some of the questions we will ask and try to answer together include: how do characters ""work""-what makes successful characterization? How do authors depict characters changing over time yet remaining recognizably who they are? How are characters shaped not only by events in a plot but by the other characters that they interact with? We will investigate these questions across a range of textual genres and media, with a few major themes as our focus: the stability of characters across time or multiple texts (from figures in legend to Sherlock Holmes); character as moral progression or formation; and character relationality. We'll consider the question of ""relatability"" and why it might (or might not!) matter and examine characters' hierarchical relationships within the plot (e.g., major vs. minor characters, protagonist and sidekick, etc.) and how these intersect with the social hierarchies of these character' worlds. By taking one key aspect of narrative and thinking about it together in sustained, serious, and playful ways, our goal will be to gain a greater understanding and appreciation of how stories meditate on personhood in all its complexity.",Spring,"CMLT 32310, NEHC 32310, NEHC 22310",,Jane Gordon

CMLT 22501,Vico's New Science. 100 Units.,"This course offers a close reading of Giambattista Vico's masterpiece, ""The New Science"" (1744) - a work that sets out to refute ""all opinions hitherto held about the principles of humanity."" Vico, who is acknowledged as the most resolute scourge of any form of rationalism, breathed new life into rhetoric, imagination, poetry, metaphor, history, and philology in order to promote in his readers that originary ""wonder"" and ""pathos"" which sets human beings on the search for truth. However, Vico argues, the truths that are most available and interesting to us are the ones humanity ""authored"" by means of its culture and history-creating activities. For this reason the study of myth and folklore as well as archeology, anthropology, and ethnology must all play a role in the rediscovery of man. ""The New Science"" builds an ""alternative philosophy"" for a new age and reads like a ""novel of formation"" recounting the (hi)story of the entire human race and our divine ancestors. In Vico, a prophetic spirit, one recognizes the fulfillment of the Renaissance, the spokesperson of a particular Enlightenment, the precursor of the Kantian revolution, and the forefather of the philosophy of history (Herder, Hegel, and Marx). ""The New Science"" remained a strong source of inspiration in the twentieth century (Cassirer, Gadamer, Berlin, Joyce, Beckett, etc.) and may prove relevant in disclosing our own responsibilities in postmodernity.",Autumn,"FNDL 21408, CMLT 32501, ITAL 22900, ITAL 32900",,Rocco Rubini

We will study how a seemingly simple living or non-living object can be a guide, source, muse, and catalyst for social, political, and cultural knowledge. How do thinkers mix scholarly critique with creative/generative practices like autobiography, ancestral storytelling, and speculative fiction to express the politics of the earth? In a final research paper intersecting literary art, activism, and critique, students will reflect on this question to frame their own ecological obsessions. The course literature will focus on themes like deep time, extractivism, futurity, the nature-culture divide, and the relationships between human and nonhuman life. We will close-read representative modern and contemporary works of ecological obsessions from Julio Cortazar's ""Axolotl"" to Robin Wall Kimmerer's Braiding Sweetgrass.",Winter,"CMLT 32515, CEGU 22515, ENGL 22515",,Natalie Cortez Klossner

This seminar takes this starting point -the thick of chattel slavery, mercantile capitalism, and colonial violence - to investigate literary productions by racialized others dispersed in and by the so-called era of modernity. We will complicate what constitutes the modernity and how Islam, perhaps more than any other tradition, has been configured as its inverse. We will read works ranging from poetry, novels, short stories, comics, & memoirs as they relate to encounters & engagements particularly with Islam as a religious tradition, colonialism, industrialization, & nationalism, even as global understandings of tradition, genre, & form are being contested & rapidly changing. In addition to primary sources, we will theoretically situate these works within larger discussions of racecraft, oral transmission & culture, ""folk"" vs. ""high"" literature, Orientalism, politics, gender, sexuality, & identity. We will look at this is articulated in diasporic literary forms written within -and sometimes for- the imperial core. Through in-class discussions, readings, & a final paper, students will strengthen their global literacy, demonstrate knowledge of global historical trends, analyze the shifting and even contradictory interpretations of the role of religion in racial formations, all while identifying, critiquing & assessing these key course themes.",Autumn,"ISLM 36717, RDIN 32700, RLST 26717, RDIN 22700, CMLT 32700, AASR 36717, GLST 22710",,Samah Choudhury

If being ""social"" amounts above all to an acknowledgement of the plurality of human lives and an acquiescence to live together with others, what then does it mean to reject such a fundamental premise? In this course, we will investigate a variety of fictional characters who cannot or will not conform with the implicit conventions of communal life-criminals, lunatics, or simply people who find themselves struggling to sympathize with the feelings of others, etc. In tackling the aforementioned questions, our inquiry will be guided by a range of distinct methodological approaches such as moral philosophy, psychoanalysis, and queer theory. Readings may include works by Lu Xun, Ma-Xu Weibang, Yi Sang, Kinugasa Teinosuke, Edogawa Rampo, Akutagawa Ryūnosuke, Dazai Osamu, Mishima Yukio, Abe Kōbō, Murakami Haruki, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Herman Melville, Samuel Beckett, Gaston Leroux, Aimé Césaire, and Derek Jarman.

We will begin with La Noire de... (1966), by the ""father"" of African cinema, Ousmane Sembene, contrasted w/ a South African film, African Jim (1960) that more closely resembles African American musical film, and anti-colonial and anti-apartheid films from Lionel Rogosin's Come Back Africa (1959) to Sarah Maldoror's Sambizanga, Sembene's Camp de Thiaroye (1984), and Jean Marie Teno's Afrique, Je te Plumerai (1995). The rest of the course will examine 20th and 21st century films such as I am a not a Witch and The wound (both 2017), which show tensions between urban and rural, traditional and modern life, and the implications of these tensions for women and men, Western and Southern Africa, in fiction, documentary and fiction film.

Fuller's passion for the German Romantics and their propagation in America is representative of the profound importance that the ""American Transcendentalists"" (Emerson, Thoreau, Fuller) attributed to German literature and its potential to shape American culture and values. In this course, we will explore the elective affinities between German Romanticism and its American counterpart, tracing the ways in which the two traditions mutually illuminate each other. Each unit will pair one major German and one major American text or artwork. Themes / pairings include: gender and mythology in Novalis' fragmentary novel Heinrich von Ofterdingen and Fuller's fairy tales; spiritual landscapes in the paintings of Caspar David Friedrich and the Hudson River School; slavery and abolition in Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit and Thoreau's ""Civil Disobedience;"" exemplarity and individualism in Emerson's ""Self-Reliance"" and Nietzsche's ""Schopenhauer as Educator.""",Spring,"ENGL 23421, GRMN 23421",,Simon Friedland
CMLT 23710,The Underground Book. 100 Units.,"Throughout the second half of the twentieth century, there was an explosion in the practice of ""underground"" publishing-- that is, textual objects produced through unofficial, and often illegal, presses. In this undergraduate seminar, we will investigate this phenomenon across a range of transnational contexts. We will begin by considering the theoretical and practical concerns of underground publication. We will then examine how underground publishing manifested in locations as diverse as the late Soviet Union, 1980s Chicago, and Brazil under military dictatorship. We will conclude the course by considering how the rise of digital media has shaped the nature of underground publishing. Throughout, we will pay particular attention to the book as a material object, questioning the ways in which materiality shapes and determines underground reading practices. As part of this seminar, students will gain hands-on experience with various aspects of bookmaking and printmaking. By reproducing underground publication techniques, we will develop first-hand knowledge of the material challenges and opportunities associated with the self-publishing medium. In the final weeks of the course, students will have the chance to produce their own book object.

CMLT 24419,Kafka: Acrobatics of Reading. 100 Units.,"In a universe determined by power such as Kafka's - patriarchal, legal, governmental, colonial power, but also physical constraints such as gravity and entropy - everything depends on one's ability or inability to perform. Against such determination, Kafka's texts work as exercises in self-empowerment and -disempowerment, acts that constitute their power to perform through their very performance. Taking Kafka's short prose as a test case, the course investigates the relationship between two things: First, the acrobatics performed in and by the texts that not only feature a cast of tightrope walkers, hunger artists, bucket riders, and other performers, but can more generally be read as a series of kinetic experiments involving plot, description, imagery, sound, and grammar. Second, the acrobatics it takes us, the audience, to engage these texts-demanding a similar artistry of performance that includes casting highly flexible, improbable, and often risky readerly strategies in response. From the short prose, the course broadens its focus to include the longer texts and the diary, as well as excerpts from the fragments Amerika, The Trial, and The Castle.

We now find kawaii in clothing, food, toys, engineering, films, music, personal appearance, behavior and mannerisms, and even in government. With the popularity of Japanese entertainment, fashion and other consumer products abroad, kawaii has also become a global cultural idiom in a process Christine Yano has called ""Pink Globalization"".

By engaging in weekly case-studies around four central authors (Samuel Constantine Rafinesque, Pierre Louys, James Macpherson, Thomas Carlyle), students will learn to describe and categorize different kinds of such ""flippancies"" and to articulate their political weight across time. Examples include invented poems from Ancient Greece, spurious Native American epics, forged ancient Scottish epics, and the like. Our study of the main texts will be accompanied by a look at other forgeries that have played a not so fake role in the course of history (such as the Donation of Constantine).

What common condition unites us as a species across race, gender, and ethnicity? In this course, we will explore these questions through the lens of twentieth-century German thinkers who placed the human being at the center of philosophical inquiry. Seeking an alternative to both religious and scientific accounts, the philosophers Max Scheler, Arnold Gehlen, and Helmut Plessner developed new conceptions of the human that sought to do justice to both our spiritual and our biological being. We will take an historical approach to this intellectual movement, considering how philosophers such as Herder, Kant, and Nietzsche laid the groundwork for a reevaluation of who we are. In the conviction that literature also plays a vital role in formulating a philosophical anthropology, we will also consider several poets, in particular Friedrich Hölderlin and Rainer Maria Rilke.

We will consider three major moments and sites of a multi-centered conversation. First, we will explore the modernist desire for cosmopolitanism which drew writers across the Atlantic (Simone de Beauvoir's adventures in the US; Djuna Barnes and Gertrude Stein's lives in Paris). In the central part of the quarter, we will focus on the period between 1960 and 1990 which witnessed intense conversation and contestation between a French paradigm of ""écriture féminine"" (Hélène Cixous, Monique Wittig), and the rivalling practices and theories in America (from Adrienne Rich and Mary Daly to Judith Butler). Finally, we will explore the ways in which recent feminist writers have accounted for race, class, and disability (from Maryse Condé to Liliane Giraudon).

CMLT 24825,Fictions of Money: From Glamor Girls to Faustian Bargains. 100 Units.,"Since the advent of modern capitalism, money has exerted an inexorable influence on the cultural imagination, which has reacted to financial transformations such as the advent of paper money, hyperinflation, and economic crashes and ""miracles"" with a host of cultural myths, or ""fictions of money."" Bringing social theories of money (Simmel, Canetti, Kracauer, Rotman) into conversation with literature and film, this class will examine how money is more than just a price or value for commodities, but in fact acts as a primary mediator for human desires and social relations. If money truly ""makes the world go round,"" then it is not just a subject of fiction, but a key social fiction (as Marx already suggests). We will explore fictions of money from two interrelated perspectives: 1) How is money represented in fiction? (e.g. Is it a source of social cohesion or disruption, even decay? Is it tied to specific objects, human practices, or desires?); and 2) How is money tied to other sorts of social fictions, e.g. notions about class, gender, race, and religion? Readings will span the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, addressing fictional works from Goethe, Chamisso, Droste-Hülshoff, Keun, and Dürrenmatt, and films by Fritz Lang, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, and Djibril and Djibril Diop Mambéty, among others.

Additionally, we extend our timeline beyond the collapse of the Soviet Union to explore how the historical Sino-Soviet alliance is perceived in the present day. Our primary focus will be on state-level politics and highbrow artistic-literary production, but we will also address the social history of the vast border regions and the biographies of key individuals.

What is it about the KJV that has so obsessed readers and writers? How has it become part of and affected world literature? Are there competing ways of conceiving the biblical text in English literature? In this course, we will trace some of the KJV's thematic and stylistic influences in global Anglophone literature; sometimes we will deal with direct allusion and rewriting, and other times we will study the possibilities of more tenuous links. In parallel to this work, we will problematize the KJV's astounding centrality by: examining some pre-KJV literature and alternative early-modern and 20th century translations (particularly as these intersect with Jewish tradition); attending to subversive and postcolonial literary uses of the translation; and close-reading the political and ideological motivations behind certain forms of critical adulation.

In this course we will ask these and other related questions as they are presented and represented in Italian 20th century literary texts, read alongside philosophical writings, scholarly essays, and visual materials. While maintaining a focus on Italian literature, a comparative approach involving literary works of non-Italian authors will be key in understanding the pervasiveness of the problems that have caused our detachment from nature and our broken relationship with nonhuman animals. We will closely analyze and critically evaluate the works of several authors, including those by Italo Calvino, Primo Levi, Anna Maria Ortese, Elsa Morante, Italo Svevo, Alice Walker, and Franz Kafka, giving particular attention to techniques of close reading. A thematic approach will enable us to explore a large number of critical discourses, from the moral status of nonhuman animals to the long-held assumptions regarding the anthropocentric set of values that have defined (Western) culture. We will also take into consideration different theoretical frameworks such as posthumanist theory and gender studies in order to discuss and evaluate the selected texts from different perspectives and entry points.",,"GNSE 25218, ITAL 25218",,E.

CMLT 25550,Machiavelli: Politics and Theater. 100 Units.,"Arguably the most debated political theorist of all time due to The Prince, Machiavelli genuinely aspired to be remembered for his creative prowess. He explored various literary genres, such as short stories, dialogues, satirical poetry, letter writing, and, notably, theater, where he demonstrated mastery with The Mandrake, an exemplary Renaissance comedy. This course aims to reintegrate these two aspects of Machiavelli: the serious politician and the facetious performer, a Janus-faced figure who serves as a precursor of both Hobbes and Montaigne. We will revive the image of this ""Renaissance man,"" and, through him, shed light on his era and fellow humanists by restoring their intellectual unity of prescription and laughter. Indeed, we will discover that Machiavelli encourages us not to take things, including him and ourselves, too seriously!

The course includes discussion of Machiavelli as playwright (""The Mandrake""), fiction writer (""Belfagor,"" ""The Golden Ass""), and historian (""Discourses,"" ""Florentine Histories""). We will also closely investigate the emergence of myths surrounding Machiavelli (Machiavellism and anti-Machiavellism) in Italy (Guicciardini, Botero, Boccalini), France (Bodin and Gentillet), Spain (Ribadeneyra), and Northern Europe (Hobbes, Grotius, Spinoza) during the Counter Reformation and beyond.",,"ITAL 23000, CMLT 35801, ITAL 33001, FNDL 21603",,Rocco Rubini
CMLT 25810,"Childhood and Fairy Tale in Bachelard, Benjamin, and Agamben. 100 Units.","'The child' is a complex and fascinating notion that plays a crucial role in the writings of some of the major twentieth-century thinkers. The child is often linked to 'fairy tale,' as if one concept couldn't exist without the other. What constitutes a fairy tale, what is the difference between fairy tale, myth, and allegory, and who is the real narrator and listener of fairy tales are questions that can only be addressed through a second, fundamental query: What is 'the child'? What does 'the child' represent? What role does the imagination play in the formation of 'the child'? These issues are especially significant in the writings of Gaston Bachelard, Walter Benjamin, and Giorgio Agamben. Readings will include: Bachelard, ""Poetics of Reverie: Childhood, Language, and the Cosmos""; Bachelard, ""Air and Dreams. An Essay on the Imagination of Movement""; Bachelard, ""The Flame of a Candle""; Benjamin, One-Way Street; Benjamin, ""The Fireside Saga""; Benjamin, ""Berlin Childhood around 1900""; Benjamin ""Goethe's Elective Affinities,""; Benjamin, ""The Storyteller""; Agamben, ""Infancy and History""; Agamben, ""Profanations""; Agamben, ""Pulcinella or Entertainment for Children""; Agamben, ""Pinocchio"".

We will also read scholarship that will help us place the production and reception of these primary sources in historical, political, cultural and religious contexts. In particular, we will examine questions of history and continuity (recurrent themes and images); form and genre (differences of representation in mythological narratives, poetry, biography, fiction, erotic/legal/medical treatises); the relationship of gender to sexuality (differences and similarities between representations of male-male and female-female relations); queerness as a site for exploring other differences, such as caste or religious difference; and questions of cross-cultural and transnational dialogue and cultural specificity.",Autumn,"GNSE 23145, CRES 26115, HMRT 26113, SALC 26113",,Nisha Kommattam
CMLT 26211,The World in Ruins. 100 Units.,"In this course we will not limit ourselves to the traditional view of 'ruins' as remains of ancient or modern buildings. Our course will involve a variety of different artifacts (literary texts, paintings, films, philosophical tracts, etc.) from different cultural moments, in order to attain a clearer understanding of our notion of ruins, decay, and decadence. We will first examine 'ruins' in classical cultures, focusing on Plutarch's short treatise On the Obsolescence of Oracles. We will investigate the 'discovery' of ruins in the Renaissance through Petrarch's Letters on Familiar Matters, his canzoniere, and his epic poem Africa, Francesco Colonna's verbal/visual Hypnerotomachia Poliphili (The Strife of Love in a Dream), and Joaquim De Bellay's The Antiquities of Rome. 17th-century approach to ruins and decay will focus on Benjamin's texts (Origins of the German Tragic Drama among others), Agamben's response to Benjamin in Man Without Content, and European poetry and paintings. After an analysis of Piranesi's famous etchings Vedute di Roma, we will approach Romanticism through Leopardi's and Hölderlin's works. There will be a screening of Pasolini's The Walls of Sana'a (1970), which will open our discussion of the concepts of decay and annihilation in modern times. We will read Curzio Malaparte's novel The Skin and W. G.

With equal and opposite force, why shouldn't we believe them? Are the standards of acceptable belief entirely independent of what we're told by religious authorities, or is it impossible to arrive at any such standards without presuming something we've been told? When confronted with diverse claims about the divine, should we try to ascertain which ones are true, should we combine or harmonize them in some way, or should we dismiss the entire conversation as wrongheaded? In this course, we'll think through these questions with the help of influential texts drawn from the Buddhist, Hindu, Platonic, and classical Chinese traditions.",Spring,"RLST 26269, DVPR 36269",,Stephen C.

The way we see ourselves, the values we cherish, derive from the Renaissance. Modernity is a product of the Renaissance. This course emphasizes the importance of introspection in Renaissance culture, poetry, and philosophy. The books I have selected have a strong autobiographical element. However, they also illuminate how the Renaissance theorizes the relationship between the individual and society. We will read, in Italian, passages from major Italian texts in prose, such as Castiglione's Il cortigiano, Machiavelli's Discorsi, Campanella's Città del Sole, and poetry by Michelangelo, Monsignor della Casa, and numerous women poets, such as Veronica Franco, Vittoria Colonna, and Veronica Gambara.",,ITAL 22200,,A.

CMLT 26680,Literary Games: Oulipo and Onward. 100 Units.,"Does constraint foster creativity? Can wordplay carry political meaning? Is formal innovation divorced from lyrical expression? How do experimental literary movements respond to their sociopolitical moments and local contexts, and how do they transform when they travel across geographical and linguistic borders? We will consider these questions via the work of the longest-lived French literary group, the Oulipo (Ouvroir de littérature potentielle or Workshop for Potential Literature), examining its origins as a quasi-secret society in 1960 and its expansion into an internationally visible and multilingual collective (with members from Italy, Spain, Argentina, and the US). We will investigate debates about inspiration and authorship, copying and plagiarism, collective creation, multilingualism, constraint and translation, and the viability of the lyric subject. While considering antecedents (Edgar Allan Poe, Raymond Roussel), our readings will explore several generations of Oulipians (Raymond Queneau, Georges Perec, Italo Calvino, Michèle Métail, Anne Garréta, Frédéric Forte), and conclude with some very contemporary Oulipo-inspired writing from around the world (Christian Bök, Urayoán Noel, Mónica de la Torre, K.

Ficino's philosophical masterpiece is the foundation of the Renaissance view of love from a Neo-Platonic perspective. It is impossible to overemphasize its influence on European culture. On Love is not just a radically new interpretation of Plato's Symposium. It is the book through which sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe read the love experience. Our course will analyze its multiple classical sources and its spiritual connotations. During our close reading of Ficino's text, we will show how European writers and philosophers appropriated specific parts of this Renaissance masterpiece. In particular, we will read extensive excerpts from some important love treatises, such as Castiglione's The Courtier (Il cortigiano), Leone Ebreo's Dialogues on Love, Tullia d'Aragona's On the Infinity of Love, but also selections from a variety of European poets, such as Michelangelo's canzoniere, Maurice Scève's Délie, and Fray Luis de León's Poesía.",,"CMLT 36701, FNDL 21103, ITAL 23900, REMS 33900, ITAL 33900",,A.

This course will focus on one example of religious-cultural-philosophical adaptation and change through a study of the medieval translation of Arabic and Judeo-Arabic works into Hebrew during the 12th-15th centuries.

In this course, we will delve into the ""world of difference"" that exists between viewing islands as remote and insignificant, and considering them as crucial nodes in an ever-expanding planetary network. Simultaneously, we will consider the stakes of moving away from traditional representations of the ocean as a blank canvas for human movement, to instead consider it as a vibrant material and multispecies space. This course will encourage students to formulate their own approaches to cutting-edge debates in archipelagic theory and critical ocean studies, and to situate those debates within the broader fields of environmental humanities and postcolonial studies.

In this introductory seminar, students explore answers to this question, focusing on the ways epics dramatize the human relationship to divinity. We read the epics through the relationships of its central characters-humans, heroes, and gods. By following the winding quests and gory battles of these narratives, students examine how epics present various forms of human-divine relationships-transactional, intimate, inspirational, and manipulative. We employ a comparative approach to the genre; our readings originate in different world regions and historical periods-from ancient India and Greece to West Africa, England, and the contemporary US. We will read these texts closely and examine how they reflect particular views of the human condition within religious worldviews. Considering the contexts of post-colonization, nationalism, and globalization, we analyze how mass media-comic books, TV series, films, and social media-shape and spread those views to new popular audiences.",Spring,"RLST 26802, SALC 26802, GLST 26802",,Andrew Kunze
CMLT 26855,Queer Theory. 100 Units.,"This course offers a foundation in queer theory. In order to understand the contested definitions of the term ""queer"" and explore the contours of the field's major debates, we will work to historicize queer theory's emergence in the 1980s and 1990s amidst the AIDS crisis. Reading texts by key figures like Foucault, Sedgwick, Butler, Lorde, Bersani, Crimp, Warner, Halperin, Dinshaw, Edelman, Anzaldúa, Ferguson, and Muñoz in addition to prominent issues of journals like GLQ, differences, and Signs, we will approach these pieces as historical artifacts and place these theorists within the communities of intellectuals, activists, and artists out of which their work emerged. We will, thus, imagine queer theory as a literary practice of mournful and militant devotion, trace queer theory's relationship to feminism and critical race theory, critique the hagiographic tendency of the academic star system, and interrogate the assumptions of queer theory's secularity.",Spring,"CMLT 36855, RLST 26885, ENGL 36855, RLVC 36855, GNSE 36855, ENGL 26855, GNSE 20130",,Kris Trujillo

It is, in Thomas Mann's formulation, a time-novel: a novel about its time, but also a novel about human being in time. For anyone interested in the configuration of European intellectual life in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Mann's great (and challenging) novel is indispensible reading.

The term 'demon' in the Renaissance encompasses a vast variety of meanings. Demons are hybrids. They are both the Christian devils, but also synonyms for classical deities, and Neo-platonic spiritual beings. As far as Christian theology is concerned, we read selections from Augustine's and Thomas Aquinas's treatises, some complex exorcisms written in Italy, and a recent translation of the infamous ""Malleus maleficarum,"" the most important treatise on witch-hunt. We pay close attention to the historical evolution of the so-called witch-craze in Europe through a selection of the best secondary literature on this subject, with special emphasis on Michel de Certeau's ""The Possession at Loudun."" We also study how major Italian and Spanish women mystics, such as Maria Maddalena de' Pazzi and Teresa of Avila, approach the issue of demonic temptation and possession. As far as Renaissance Neoplatonic philosophy is concerned, we read selections from Marsilio Ficino's ""Platonic Theology"" and Girolamo Cardano's mesmerizing autobiography.

Sources are drawn from a range of popular cultural forms including anime and manga, but also literature, artistic performances, visual arts, and live-action movies. The course covers foundational aspects of Japanese religious life through non-traditional sources like Bleach, The Tale of Genji, and Your Name. At the end of the course, students will be able to speak to the great diversity of religious practices and viewpoints in Japan, not only its centers but also its peripheries and minorities. Meanwhile, we will consider broader questions about the complex connections between religion and popular culture. No prior knowledge of Buddhism, Shinto, or Japanese history is expected.",Winter,"MADD 14805, EALC 28405, RLST 28405",,Bruce Winkelman
CMLT 28447,It's the End of the World as We Know It: Apocalypticism and Religious Thinking about the End Times. 100 Units.,"Why and how will the world end? How much time is left? What happens to humans in those final days-and after? This course will examine art, rituals, and sacred texts - along with the movements that produced them - in order to understand how religious communities have answered such questions throughout history. Along the way, we will learn about the circumstances that have inspired Apocalyptic movements, the religious traditions that they have emerged from, and the theological and political principles that have animated them. We will cover a wide range of contexts, including Roman-occupied Judea during the first century CE, the Xhosaland of southern Africa in the mid 19th century, and the rise of QAnon and climate activism in the 21st century United States.

CMLT 28506,Jesus: From Scripture to the Silver Screen. 100 Units.,"Jesus holds particular significance for believers all around the world. But how is he portrayed in modern films? How faithful are these depictions to the Bible? Do these portrayals push a certain kind of theological position? In this course, we will examine film adaptations of Jesus, including biopics, dramas, comedies, and musicals. As we watch everything from Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ (1988) to Monty Python's Life of Brian (1979), we will compare these modern depictions to ancient texts and theology. During the course, students will become familiar with significant aspects of Jesus's life both in canonical and noncanonical Gospels, as well as to how those texts have been understood in the antiquity and today. After the class, students will be able to analyze critically portrayals of Jesus in order to understand why certain decisions are made and address pivotal questions about biblical interpretation, cinema and adaptation, and the ethical challenges of representing religious figures in media. No prior familiarity with biblical studies or film criticism is required.",Spring,RLST 28506,,Richard Zaleski
CMLT 28509,Reinterpretations of Time and Death. 100 Units.,"This class will explore philosophical, religious and literary reimaginings and reconceptualizations of the nature of time and of death. Of special concern will be both conceptual and imaginative speculations that contravene commonsensical notions such as 1) time as a sequence of nonconsecutive and nonoverlapping ""moments,"" 2) time as unidirectional, 3) time as uninterrupted, 4) time as synordinate, 5) time as nonrepeating, 6) death as either the end of individual consciousness or the continuation of individual consciousness, 7) death as either leading to consequences of the life lived or having no such consequences, and so on.

We will read both epics in translation, consider the consequences of their recovery for world literature, and look at expansions on their narratives by contemporary writers. How is our understanding of literature changed by the sudden emergence of an unknown masterpiece? What does it look like to respond to an instant classic? What gaps need to be filled, which parts would we rather were missing, and how do contemporary writers add on in a way that feels authentic to the original?",Winter,"FNDL 28150, NEHC 28550",,Mark Payne

CMLT 28660,Contemporary Palestinian Life Writing. 100 Units.,"This course analyzes a range of Palestinian life narratives produced by authors based in different places, both in Palestine and the diaspora, united in a common cause and a desire to speak out, thereby circulating their works as a form of Palestinian testimony. This course sees these writers conversing with each other, each attempting to represent their own personal experience but also responding to the broader context of ongoing Palestinian dispossession, making this integral to the snapshot of experience they want to narrate. This course shows that such texts, individually meaningful but also conversant with wider concerns and messages of solidarity and advocacy, are ideal components of contemporary Palestinian literature that position itself as future-orientated, and expresses a desire to combat the international community's failure to acknowledge Palestinian rights for justice and self-determination. This course contends that contemporary Palestinian life writing goes beyond narrating the specifics of the conflict in order to reflect on central questions of dignity, justice, and solidarity at the time Palestine is still a place that is not fully recognized. All readings will be in English, although there will be an opportunity to read and discuss texts in the original language (Arabic).",Winter,"ENGL 28661, NEHC 28660, ENGL 38661, NEHC 38660, RDIN 28660, CMLT 38660, RDIN 38660",,Ahmad Qabaha

Written in English, the novel appears to be easily accessible to a global audience, but in fact the narrative contains dense layers of micro-regional, specific nuances that can easily escape readers and that warrant closer examination. In this course, we will read the novel closely with fresh eyes, pairing the fictional text with select secondary sources on gender, caste, class, history, communism, regionalism, vernacularity, migration, diaspora and trauma.

CMLT 28800,The (Auto)Biography of a Nation: Francesco De Sanctis and Benedetto Croce. 100 Units.,"At its core, this course examines the making and legacy of Francesco De Sanctis's History of Italian Literature (1870-71), a work that distinguished literary critic René Wellek defined as ""the finest history of any literature ever written"" and ""an active instrument of aesthetic evolution."" We will read the History in the larger context of De Sanctis's corpus, including his vast epistolary exchanges, autobiographical writings, and so-called Critical Essays in order to detail his reform of Hegelian aesthetics, his redefinition of the intellectual's task after the perceived exhaustion of the Renaissance, Enlightenment, and Romantic moments, and his campaign against the bent toward erudition, philology, and antiquarianism in 19th-century European scholarship. We will compare De Sanctis's methodology to that of his scholarly models in France (Alphonse de Lamartine, Alfred Mézières) and Germany (Georg Gottfried Gervinus, Georg Voigt) to explore De Sanctis's claim that literary criticisms - not just literary cultures - are ""national."" In the second part of the course, we assess Benedetto Croce's appropriation of De Sanctis in his Aesthetics (1902), arguably the last, vastly influential work in its genre and we conclude with Antonio Gramsci's use of De Sanctis for the regeneration of a literary savvy Marxism or philosophy of praxis.",,"KNOW 37700, CMLT 38800, ITAL 27700, KNOW 27700, ITAL 37700",,R.

Like many at the time, the Oppemanns think that the regime will be short-lived, but Feuchtwanger's prescient novel anticipates the entrenchment of Nazi power and the creeping curtailment of Jewish life in Germany with uncanny accuracy-from the thugs attacking individuals to the Ministry of Propaganda's demonization of Jewish Germans in mass media, via the enforced ""Aryanization"" of businesses required to employ non-Jewish managers. Discussion will focus on Feuchtwanger's nuanced portrayal of the distinct ways in which family members react to these assaults, supplemented by historical texts, including the analysis of Nazi language (1946) by Victor Klemperer, a Jewish-German survivor, and documents in the Weimar Republic Sourcebook.",Spring,"GRMN 28872, FNDL 28872, JWSC 28872, ENGL 28872",Required: Complete HUM core,Loren Kruger

Set in a Renaissance past of courtly international intrigue, the novel plumbs its characters' interiorized struggles with erotic desire, marriage, and adultery, forging a path for later novelists such as Flaubert, George Eliot, and Tolstoy. We will examine debates about its literary form and moral impact, as well as around gender and women's writing, placing the novel in a transnational context (Spanish, Italian, and English romances, drama, and moral philosophy) and its later reception, including film adaptations and its role in heated contemporary controversies around the place of the humanities in society.

We investigate the relationship between South East European self-representations and the imagined Western gaze. Inherent in the act of looking at oneself through the eyes of another is the privileging of that other's standard. We will contemplate the responses to this existential position of identifying symbolically with a normative site outside of oneself-self-consciousness, defiance, arrogance, self-exoticization-and consider how these responses have been incorporated in the texture of the national, gender, and social identities in the region.

Recent papers in the field of Distributed Systems have described several solutions (such as MapReduce, BigTable, Dynamo, Cassandra, etc.) for managing large-scale data and computation. However, building and using these systems pose a number of more fundamental challenges: How do we keep the system operating correctly even when individual machines fail? How do we ensure that all the machines have a consistent view of the system's state? (And how do we ensure this in the presence of failures?) How can we determine the order of events in a system where we can't assume a single global clock? Many of these fundamental problems were identified and solved over the course of several decades, starting in the 1970s.

From Capote's In Cold Blood to Milton's Paradise Lost, from Bulgakov's Master and Margarita to Arendt's Eichmann in Jerusalem and Sabato's The Tunnel, literature returns again and again to the question of evil and the concept of opposition. This course is designed to explore this question alongside authors who have devoted their lives to understanding the role of evil in literature, its necessity, its appeal, its frivolity and its betrayal. The course will be divided into three section, each section devoted to a specific genre during which two to three texts will be explored, discussed and analyzed in class, and at the end of which one brief analysis paper will be due.

CRWR 12141,Intro to Genres: Drawing on Graphic Novels. 100 Units.,"Like film, comics are a language, and there's much to be learned from studying them, even if we have no intention of 'writing' them. Comics tell two or more stories simultaneously, one via image, the other via text, and these parallel stories can not only complement but also contradict one another, creating subtexts and effects that words alone can't. Or can they? Our goal will be to draw, both literally and metaphorically, on the structures and techniques of the form. While it's aimed at the aspiring graphic novelist (or graphic essayist, or poet), it's equally appropriate for those of us who work strictly with words (or images). What comics techniques can any artist emulate, approximate, or otherwise aspire to, and how can these lead us to a deeper understanding of the possibilities of point of view, tone, structure and style? We'll learn the basics of the medium via Ivan Brunetti's book Cartooning: Philosophy and Practice, as well as Syllabus, by Lynda Barry. Readings include the scholar David Kunzle on the origins of the form, the first avant-garde of George Herriman, Frank King, and Lyonel Feininger, finishing with contemporaries like Chris Ware, Emil Ferris and Alison Bechdel.

Alongside writing that renders embodiment and the physical world, we'll read writing that makes abstraction feel concrete. Our weekly readings will guide our ongoing inquiry into questions such as: what constitutes an image? How does writing enact feeling? How do the sensory elements of a piece intensify or erode or expand its subject, and to what end? Texts will include poetry and prose by Sei Shōnagon, Francis Ponge, Carlos Drummond de Andrade, Gwendolyn Brooks, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Wanda Coleman, Vasko Popa, Lorine Niedecker, Ai, Durga Chew-Bose, Shane McCrae, Jenny Zhang, Justin Torres, James Baldwin, Deborah Eisenberg, and many others.

We'll then study poems, essays, and stories that refute themselves and self-revise as they unfold, dramatizing mixed feelings and changing minds. We'll end by considering erasure poetry as a form of critical revision. Our conversations will inspire weekly writing exercises and invite you to experiment with various creative revision strategies.

CRWR 12147,Intro to Genres: The River's Running Course. 100 Units.,"Rivers move--over land, through history, among peoples--and they make: landscapes and civilizations. They are the boundaries on our maps, the dividers of nations, of families, of the living and the dead, but they are also the arteries that connect us. They are meditative, meandering journeys and implacable, surging power. They are metaphors but also so plainly, corporeally themselves. In this course, we will encounter creative work about rivers, real and imaginary, from the Styx to the Amazon. Through poetry, fiction, nonfiction, and drama, we will consider what rivers are, what they mean to us, and how they are represented in art and literature. Rivers will be the topic and inspiration for our own creative writing, too. The goal for this course is to further your understanding of creative writing genres and the techniques that creative writers employ to produce meaningful work in each of those genres. You will also practice those techniques yourselves as write your own creative work in each genre. Our weekly sessions will involve a mixture of discussions, brief lectures, student presentations, mini-workshops and in-class exercises. Most weeks, you will be responsible for a creative and/or critical response (300-500 words) to the reading, and the quarter will culminate in a final project (7-10 pages) in the genre of your choice, inspired by the Chicago River.",Autumn,"CHST 12147, ENST 22147",Open bid through my.uchicago.edu.

CRWR 12151,Intro to Genres: The Gothic Lens. 100 Units.,"The Gothic is arguably the most evocative of all storytelling genres. As haunting as it is seductive in its ambiguities and luridly symbolic tropes, no form more powerfully captures our encounters with the irrational and the inexplicable, whether in nature, in others, or in ourselves. In this Arts Core course, we will approach the genre through all its forbidding yet intimate qualities. As we read Gothic fiction from different eras and cultures, from both a reader's perspective and a writer's perspective (the why/how/who of the author's decisions), we'll cover concepts like the sublime, the uncanny, and abjection, examining the work's sociopolitical layers but aiming our brightest light on its psychological underpinnings. We'll ask ourselves: in what ways does the Gothic mirror the most vulnerable and obscure aspects of the self? What might these extraordinary stories of transgression, violence, or supernatural conflict reveal about the horrors of ordinary life, the vagaries of our hidden desires, anxieties, and pathologies? Our focus on the psychological and evocative nature of the genre, especially from a writer's point of view, will also help us write our Gothic Scenes, where everyone will apply their own intimate ""gothic lens"" to memorable encounters from their recent past.

CRWR 12156,Fundamentals: A Gathering of Flowers: The Anthology. 100 Units.,"In 1925, The New Negro: An Interpretation, a collection of poems, short stories, and essays was published-it ushered a new era, what was then called the New Negro Renaissance. An artistic and literary movement with the objective to subvert what Alain Locke called the ""Old Negro,"" by providing a corrective and aspirational image of contemporary Negro life, was borne. Around forty years later, Black Arts: An Anthology galvanized the Black Arts Movement, what Larry Neal called the ""aesthetic and spiritual sister"" of the Black Power Movement. The Best American Short Stories and the Norton Anthology of Literature by Women are two more examples of anthologies, one to cultivate the genre and the other to recover the literature of marginalized women writers. In this course, we'll examine anthologies, a word derived from the Greek for ""a gathering of flowers."" As we study these ""flowers,"" we'll discern the objectives that shape their construction, as well as what was put in and what was left out.

Whether jailed, expelled, excommunicated, or burned at the stake, their (anti)heroic antics have challenged, critiqued, or, some might say, corrupted the laws, mores, and sensibilities of societies. If it is true that polite, well-behaved women rarely make history, then what do impolite, badly-behaved women teach us about the construction of (his) story? In this course, we'll examine literature from around the world featuring members of the Bad Girls Club, who in opposing complimentary constructions of femininity, femaleness, and power invite introspection on the gendered nature of story and storytelling.

CRWR 12160,Reading as a Writer: Exploring the Weird. 100 Units.,"In 1917 the Russian critic Viktor Shklovsky coined the word 'ostranenie,'-translating roughly as 'defamiliarization'-to illustrate a concept that asks the writer or artist to see the everyday in new and unfamiliar ways. In fiction writing this means avoiding cliché while cultivating elements of surprise, the unexpected, the strange. It means the author offering a new perspective on something familiar, something surprising and, often, yes, a little weird. So what does it mean to follow the weird as a fiction or creative non-fiction writer? As a poet? How can we indulge that strange, uncanny, often suppressed side of ourselves in a way that not only serves a work of literary art but opens it up to new possibilities? This class will look at ways writers use defamiliarization and other techniques to create unexpected and sometimes jarring effects and will encourage students to take similar risks in their own writing. Students will view read various works of fiction, poetry, creative non-fiction, view films, and read critical and craft- oriented texts.

In this course, we will study literary works that have been banned or censored as ""obscene"" to examine our own perspectives, attitudes, and assumptions as literary artists. How does obscenity shape our understanding of gender and sexuality, race and ethnicity, or public and private speech? What are the uses of obscenity in constructing new possibilities for literary expression? Authors studied will include Toni Morrison, Tanizaki Jun'ichirō, Vladimir Nabokov, Hilda Hilst, and Allen Ginsburg; and we will supplement these readings with works of literary theory, psychoanalysis, and case law.

While such awards certainly elevate translation as a mode of writing comparable to that of other literary arts, they also raise important questions about the production, circulation, and reception of translated literature in the Anglosphere. In this course, we will read a number of recent award-winning books in English translation (both poetry and prose), considering how these books traveled from origin to translation, and how we as readers engage with them - as translations and as literary texts. How are translations made? How do we evaluate books that have two writers: author and translator? What larger forces (social, aesthetic, commercial, political) are at work when deciding which translated books will hold value for Anglophone readers? We'll explore these questions through weekly readings and discussions, student presentations, critical analyses and creative responses.

Texts will be read in conversation with both historical and contemporary writing on craft, allowing students to respond both critically and creatively to the virality of these texts, ultimately deciding for themselves how we can begin to approach the role of the artist in the age of the algorithm.",Spring,,If you wish to add this course during add/drop please email the instructor to be added to the waitlist.,Victoria Flanagan
CRWR 12169,Intro to Genres: I Know the End. 100 Units.,"Ancient Mesopotamian flood narratives, Cold War nuclear Armageddon, existential climate catastrophe: as long as literature has existed, we have used it to speculate on our own demise. In this Intro to Genres course, we will explore apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic writing, how it intersects with other genres, how it has fluctuated or remained stable as a genre over time, and how it reveals our changing cultural anxieties about what threatens us as a species. We will read broadly across poetry, fiction, nonfiction and film, exploring the various flavors of apocalyptic writing, from scientific excess to natural disasters, and examining the role style and tone play in creating meaning around devastation. Representative authors will include T.S. Elliott, Rachel Carson, Elissa Washuta, Carmen Maria Machado, Ursula K. Leguin, and Chris Marker. Students will be asked to write and workshop their own creative writing in a chosen genre and produce a critical essay that focuses on one thematic element of the class.",Spring,,If you wish to add this course during add/drop please email the instructor to be added to the waitlist.,Jonathan Gleason
CRWR 17003,Fundamentals in Creative Writing: Truth. 100 Units.,"In this class we'll study how writers define and make use of truth--whatever that is. In some cases it's the truth, singular; in others a truth, only one among many. Some writers tell it straight, others slant. Some, like Tim O'Brien, advocate story-truth, the idea that fiction tells deeper truths than facts. To get at the heart of these and other unanswerable questions we'll read writers who've written about one event in two or more modes. Nick Flynn's poems about his father, for example, which he's also set down as comic strips as well as in prose. Jeanette Winterson's first novel as well as her memoir, sixteen years later, about what she'd been too afraid to say in it. Karl Marlantes' novel about the Vietnam war, then his essays about the events he'd fictionalized. Through weekly responses, creative exercises, and longer analytic essays you'll begin to figure out your own writerly truths, as well as the differences-and intersections-between them.",Autumn,,This is class is restricted to students who have declared a major in Creative Writing or a minor in English and Creative Writing.

CRWR 17007,Fundamentals in Creative Writing: The Grammar of Narrative. 100 Units.,"Ever since humans started drawing on cave walls, the ways in which we communicate meaning through stories has been evolving. This class will look at various forms of narrative-fiction, creative non-fiction, narrative poetry, and film-and explore the ""grammar"" of these different genres, what they share and where they differ and how their particular strengths and failings influence the ways in which they most effectively communicate. How does film (a visual medium that offers a voyeuristic experience) tell a story differently than does fiction (which invites the reader to participate more in an act of shared imagination), differently than creative non-fiction, (which must always adhere to facts), differently than poetry (which condenses a story to its essences)? How is meaning conveyed differently through each? How do these different grammars influence the stories they tell and the effects they achieve? Students will view read various works of fiction, poetry, creative non-fiction, view films, and read critical and craft-oriented texts and complete weekly reading responses, as well as creative exercises. A paper focusing on a specific element from the class will be due at the end of the course.",Spring,,Students must be a declared Creative Writing major or Minor in English and Creative Writing to enroll.

CRWR 17012,Fundamentals in Creative Writing: Creative Research/The Numinous Particulars. 100 Units.,"According to Philip Gerard, ""Creative research is both a process and a habit of mind, an alertness to the human story as it lurks in unlikely places."" Creative writers may lean on research to sharpen the authenticity of their work; to liberate themselves from the confines of their personal experience; to mine existing stories and histories for details, plot, settings, characters; to generate new ideas and approaches to language, theme and story. The creative writer/researcher is on the hunt for the numinous particulars, the mysteries and human stories lurking in the finest grains of detail. In this course, we will explore the research methods used by creative writers and consider questions that range from the logistical (eg. How do I find what I need in an archive?) to the ethical (eg. How do I conscientiously write from a point of view outside my own experience?) to the aesthetic (eg. How do I incorporate all these researched details without waterlogging the poem/story/essay?). We will read poetry, fiction, and creative nonfiction that relies heavily on research and hear from established writers about the challenges of conducting and writing from research.

CRWR 17013,Fundamentals in Creative Writing: Touchstones. 100 Units.,"Most passionate readers and writers have literary touchstones --those texts we return to again and again for personal or aesthetic influence and inspiration. When we are asked what book we would want with us if we were stranded on a desert isle, our touchstones are the ones that leap immediately to mind. Some texts are fairly ubiquitous touchstones: The Great Gatsby, Harry Potter and the [take your pick], The Bell Jar, Little Women, Letters to a Young Poet, Leaves of Grass. Others are quirkier, more idiosyncratic. What -- if any -- qualities do these touchstones share, within and across genres? What lessons about writing craft can be drawn from them? In this course, we'll read texts that are commonly cited as touchstones, along with fiction, poetry, and creative nonfiction that students bring to the table -- their own literary touchstones. In that sense, our reading list will be collaborative, and students will be expected to contribute content as well as an analytical presentation on the craft issues raised by their selections.

CRWR 17014,Fundamentals in Creative Writing: A Gathering of Flowers. 100 Units.,"In 1925, The New Negro: An Interpretation, a collection of poems, short stories, and essays was published-it ushered a new era, what was then called the New Negro Renaissance. An artistic and literary movement with the objective to subvert what Alain Locke called the ""Old Negro,"" by providing a corrective and aspirational image of contemporary Negro life, was borne. Around forty years later, Black Arts: An Anthology galvanized the Black Arts Movement, what Larry Neal called the ""aesthetic and spiritual sister"" of the Black Power Movement. The Best American Short Stories and the Norton Anthology of Literature by Women are two more examples of anthologies, one to cultivate the genre and the other to recover the literature of marginalized women writers. In this course, we'll examine anthologies, a word derived from the Greek for ""a gathering of flowers."" As we study these ""flowers,"" we'll discern the objectives that shape their construction, as well as what was put in and what was left out. In short essays and exercises, we'll also investigate the social, cultural, and political contexts that influenced these objectives, as well as the resultant literary and cultural implications.

CRWR 17015,Fundamentals in Creative Writing: Sincerity (and Irony) 100 Units.,"What does it mean for a piece of writing to be ""sincere""? How do we know a (character, poem, ""I,"" essay) is ""sincere""? What does it mean to make that judgment, and what does it commit us to? How does that judgment change a reader's orientation to the object? We will approach these questions obliquely first, by thinking about how irony works. Are irony and sincerity opposites? We'll look at a range of contemporary and historical objects in fiction, nonfiction, and poetry. This will include essays by Kierkegaard, Oscar Wilde, Wayne Booth, Jonathan Swift, and R. Magill Jr., fiction by Vladimir Nabokov, Joanna Ruocco, and Kathy Acker, and poetry by Chelsey Minnis, Jenny Zhang, Amiri Baraka, and others. We'll also consider certain internet objects and think about their relationship to sincerity (and irony). This course will give students a more nuanced and historically grounded handle on these questions, and will help them develop a style of writing that's able to more intentionally (and interestingly) choose its tonal legibilities.",Autumn,,This is class is restricted to students who have declared a major in Creative Writing or a minor in English and Creative Writing.

CRWR 17016,Fundamentals in Creative Writing: The Frame Narrative. 100 Units.,"In this course, students will engage in a close examination of the various permutations of the frame narrative device across time and genre. From A Thousand and One Nights, to Hamlet, to the ""Call of Cthulhu"" and Watchmen, the ""story within a story"" construction is one of the oldest and most employed literary devices-one which can either elevate or imperil the work wherein it is utilized. Students will respond to the material in both critical and creative manners, culminating in a final analytical and creative piece that employs the craft elements discussed and unpacked in class.",Spring,,,Lina Ferreira Cabeza-Vanegas
CRWR 17017,"Fundamentals in Creative Writing: Haunted Craft, the Art of the Spectral Metaphor. 100 Units.","This course will be a close examination of the use of spectral imagery as a craft element in narratives across genre and time. From Charlotte Perkins Gilman's ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" to Emily Carrol's A Guest in the House, to Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House and Octavia Butler's Fledgling, the supernatural metaphor presents a unique stage upon which to play out questions of gender autonomy, mental health, repressed sexuality, racism and more. Students in this course will be expected to put the fantastical metaphor under a microscope and explore its potential through both creative and critical work of their own.",Spring,,,Lina Ferreira Cabeza-Vanegas
CRWR 17018,Fundamentals in Creative Writing: Desire and Longing. 100 Units.,"In fiction, it is often said that an effective character must have a clear desire. Kurt Vonnegut famously advised, ""Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water."" The idea is that desire is an animating, energizing, and focusing force in storytelling. In this course, we'll attempt to apply the animation, energy, and focus of desire to personal essays, poems, and fiction, and explore how writers depict desire and longing in a wide range of work. We'll also attempt to catalog different kinds of desire: crushes, obsessions, nostalgia, and farsickness, to name a few. We'll pay special attention to how we can write about strong emotional experiences without resorting to cliches or sentimentality. Potential texts will be Simple Passion by Annie Ernaux, Safekeeping by Abigail Thomas, Eros the Bittersweet by Anne Carson, Crush by Richard Siken, The Pillow Book by Sei Shonagon, and Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston.",Spring,,,Ryan Van Meter
CRWR 20203,Technical Seminar in Fiction: Research and World-Building. 100 Units.,"Writing fiction is in large part a matter of convincing worldbuilding, no matter what genre you write in. And convincing worldbuilding is about creating a seamless reality within the elements of that world: from setting, to social systems, to character dynamics, to the story or novel's conceptual conceit. And whether it be within a genre of science fiction, fantasy, historical fiction, or even contemporary realism, building a convincing world takes a good deal of research. So while we look closely at the tools and methods of successful worldbuilding, we will also dig into the process of research. From how and where to mine the right details, to what to look for. We will also focus on how research can make a fertile ground for harvesting ideas and even story. Students will read various works of long and short fiction with an eye to its worldbuilding, as well as critical and craft texts. They will write short weekly reading responses and some creative exercises as well. Each student will also be expected to make a brief presentation and turn in a final paper for the class.",Winter,CRWR 40203,"During pre-registration, this course is open only to declared Creative Writing Majors and declared Minors in English and Creative Writing, as well as graduate students.

CRWR 20209,Technical Seminar in Fiction: Scenes & Seeing. 100 Units.,"At the core of literary storytelling is dramatization, which enables a reader to ""see"" the world, characters, and incidents at play and to vicariously experience their emotional and psychological consequences in the story. The primary vehicle for dramatization in a story is the scene, which consists of many crucial parts: characterization, setting and imagery, dialogue and action, tone and atmosphere, subtext and thematic development. In this course we'll break down all these parts and examine how they can function on their own as well as interact to bring a moment or event to life. Where and how should a particular scene begin and end? How should information be organized? How might we determine a scene's goals in isolation and in support of the larger narrative of a short story, novella, or novel? And ultimately, beyond characters talking, acting, and reacting, how might we expand our traditional notions of what a scene is and what it can do? We'll consider such questions as we discuss exceptionally crafted scenes from short stories, novels, plays, and even film, TV, and podcasts, with an eye also on the differences in scene craft from genre to genre and what that can teach us specifically as fiction writers.

CRWR 20217,Technical Seminar in Fiction: Elements of Style. 100 Units.,"What we call style is more than literary flourish. Control of a story begins with a writer's characteristic approach to the line. Style dictates and shapes immersive and impactful worlds of our creation. It's also indicative of a work's larger themes, philosophies, and aesthetic sensibility. In this class, we'll examine fiction by wordsmiths such as James Baldwin, Gabriel García Márquez, Toni Morrison, and Marguerite Duras in order to contemplate the influence that elements such as diction, syntax, rhythm, and punctuation have on a writer's style.",Spring,CRWR 40217,Open bid through my.uchicago.edu.

This technical seminar will focus on the role of detail in maintaining this dream. In this course we will deconstruct and rebuild our understanding of concepts like simile, showing vs. telling, and symbolism, asking what these tools do and what purpose they serve. Drawing from fiction and essays from Ottessa Moshfegh, Barbara Comyns, Zadie Smith, and others, students will practice noticing, seeing anew, and finding fresh and unexpected ways of describing. We will also examine what is worthy of detail in the first place, how detail functions outside of traditional scene, and the merits and limits of specificity, mimesis, and verisimilitude. Finally we will consider what it means to travel across a landscape of vagueness and euphemism as we search for the quality of ""thisness"" that James Wood claims all great details possess.

Slowness and speed govern not just the experience of writing but also the texture of our fictional worlds. And this is something we can control. Sublimely slow writers like Sebald or Duras can make time melt; spritely magicians like Aira and Rushdie seem to shuffle planes of reality with a snap of their fingers. This seminar gathers fictions that pulse on eclectic wavelengths, asking in each case how narrative tempo embodies a fiction's character. Our exercises will play with the dial of compositional speed, testing writing quick and slow; alternately, we'll try to recreate the effects of signature texts.

In this class we will look at modeling as a springboard for original creativity. What makes a piece of writing original? Is it possible to borrow a famous writer's story structure, theme, or even attempt their voice, yet produce something wholly original? How specifically are writers influenced and then inspired? Readings will pair writers with the influences they've talked or written about, such as Yiyun Li and Anton Chekhov; Edward P. Jones and Alice Walker; Sigrid Nunez and Elizabeth Hardwick, and George Saunders and Nikolai Gogol.

Drawing on the narratological work of theorists such as Gérard Genette and Monika Fludernik and of critics such as James Wood, this technical seminar considers what point of view, perspective, and focalization can do or make possible. Readings may include stories by Jorge Luis Borges, Jamaica Kincaid, Haruki Murakami, Jenny Zhang, William Faulkner, Lorrie Moore, Jamil Jan Kochai, Italo Calvino, Ursula K. Le Guin, Gabriel García Márquez, Edith Wharton, Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette, Edwidge Danticat, Jhumpa Lahiri, Lesley Nneka Arimah, and Virginia Woolf, among others, and will introduce instances of first-person-plural and second-person narrative, as well as modes of representing speech and thought such as free indirect discourse.

In this Technical Seminar, we will mine the work of Julie Otsuka, Carmen Maria Machado, Robert Coover, Ryunosuke Akutagawa, Sigizmund Krzhizhanovsky, and other writers for strategic usage of alternative points of view, including second person, first person plural, free indirect discourse, and deliberate shifts from one point of view into another.

In this course, we will investigate the art of not telling. How do authors calibrate these gaps, showing us not too much but not too little? How do these discrepancies complicate and enrich the world of the narrative? What work do we do as readers, and how does it impact our experience?

Arguably one of the most important (and least visible) aspects of poetic composition, prosody can teach you to see and write differently. We'll begin with an introduction to historical metrics (the boring but necessary part), and then move on to studying more contemporary models. Readings will include a bit of scholarly work on prosody by Rosemary Gates and Boris Maslov, but mostly we'll read poems, from the 12th century to the 21st, that foreground prosody and rhythmic structure.

CRWR 20313,"Technical Seminar in Poetry: Against or Onto 'The Road'"" 100 Units.","This technical seminar in poetry offers writers an opportunity to examine an essential American poetic space: the road. A core question is how one reads the road's poetic surface versus its depths. Does journey itself lay out a clear narrative, admitting its forks, detours, and breakdowns? How is a basic American ""compass"" disrupted by poetic reconsiderations of ""the road?"" Does every road run ""west?"" How is the road itself as much about dislocation as it is about coherent journey? As an orientation to a poetics of space, participants will engage critical perspectives set up by Gaston Bachelard, CS Giscombe, and Rebecca Solnit. Then, writers will develop their own critical/creative responses, exploring models established by Gabe Gudding, William Least Heat-Moon, Ed Roberson, and Muriel Rukeyser. Inviting her readers to remap historical and mythic journeys, Rukeyser resets the road as a conduit into a reassessment of national narrative through The Book of the Dead. Taking his own road east, Gudding overturns a ""beat poetics"" of travel in his Rhode Island Notebook. Least Heat-Moon (Blue Highways) and Roberson (MPH and Other Road Poems) invite explorations of ""the road"" as much in time as in space or personal journey. Overall, the course remaps that road, in the words of Giscombe, itself a ""scattering [where] nothing cohered.""",Winter,CRWR 40313,If you wish to add this course during add/drop please email the instructor to be added to the waitlist.,Garin Cycholl
CRWR 20404,Technical Seminar in Nonfiction: Forms of the Essay. 100 Units.,"The essay, derived from the French term essayer meaning ""to try"" or ""to attempt,"" is not only a beloved sub-genre of creative nonfiction, but a form that yields many kinds of stories, thus many kinds of structures. Araceli Arroyo writes that the essay can ""reach its height in the form of a lyric, expand in digression, coil into a list, delve into memoir, or spring into the spire of the question itself all with grace and unexhausted energy."" In this course, we will analyze the essay's continuum, marked by traditional, linear narratives on one end, and at the other, everything else. In our class, we will investigate the relationship between content and form. What does it mean to be scene-driven? What happens when a narrative abandons chronology and event, propelled instead by language and image? What is gained through gaps and white space? You will leave this class with a strong grasp of content's relationship to form, prepared to participate effectively in creative writing workshops. You will also create a portfolio of short writings that can be expanded into longer pieces.

What stories might be found inside the hastily scrawled lines of a postcard buried in the attic or an incomplete to-do list drifting down the sidewalk? Beginning with the modern epistle and epistolary novel, this cross-genre seminar orbits the space where non-literary documents give way to artistic compositions that a given set of experts would otherwise neatly categorize and deposit somewhere literature is supposed to belong. As we practice the interplay of research and imagination toward the realization of a final project, we'll examine how writers of nonfiction and documentary poetics have used everything from blueprints of a prison cell to vaudeville ephemera to frame, develop, and heighten true stories. We'll consider ethics of authority such as information access, authentication, and journalistic objectivity alongside rhetorical matters of credibility, emotional truth, and the serviceability of facts.

This course will explore the role of research in writing creative nonfiction. Students will develop methods that play a role in writing essays, memoir, and literary journalism. The seminar will be conducted in four sequential parts: immersion research; interview techniques; library research; translating technical jargon for a public readership. Assignments will equip students with the practical steps for completing each style of research. We will also discuss how to integrate research into the descriptions, narrative, and subtext of the writing. Students will experiment with: dramatizing research through scene-building; using reflection to respond to their findings; and inviting research to become part of the plot. Research, we will find, generates some of the most dramatic and surprising moments in the writing process. We will read texts that correspond to the areas of focus, including works by Eula Biss, Daisy Hernandez, and Sarah Viren.

We'll read Carmen Maria Machado's In the Dream House and Alan Weisman's The World Without Us to deepen our thinking. Students will then practice using speculation in their own nonfiction narratives through short creative exercises. They will also write analytical papers on our chosen works to investigate how each author uses speculation to support and inspire their nonfiction narratives.",Autumn,CRWR 40414,,Rebecca Flowers
CRWR 21502,Advanced Translation Workshop. 100 Units.,"All writing is revision, and this holds true for the practice of literary translation as well. We will critique each other's longer manuscripts-in-progress of prose, poetry, or drama, and examine various revision techniques-from the line-by-line approach of Lydia Davis, to the ""driving-in-the-dark"" model of Peter Constantine, and several approaches in between. We will consider questions of different reading audiences while preparing manuscripts for submission for publication, along with the contextualization of the work with a translator's preface or afterword.

CRWR 21504,Advanced Translation Workshop: Scales of Reading. 100 Units.,"Peer review of translations-in-progress can often take the form of line edits: we discuss word choices that call attention to themselves rather than talking through the larger compositional units in which those choices are made. While a fine-grained reading is vital to revision, it can also run the risk of minimizing our critical engagement with translated texts merely on the basis of ""awkward"" or "" stilted"" language. This workshop will explore the different scales of reading employed in reviewing drafts: Yes, those instances that make us pause or take us out of the text are worth marking for the translator, but ultimately, they're only useful to the translator if we can synthesize them into a larger, coherent reading of the work as a whole. By treating translations-in-progress as literary works deserving of close readings (rather than merely manuscript pages to be edited), we'll seek to provide our peers with a critical account of our experience as the primary readers of their translations. Specifically, we'll practice grounding our accounts in aspects of craft and structure, form and content, in order to move beyond our subjectivities as readers and our idiolects as writers - and better understand how a translated work's larger concerns are enacted in the language itself. Students with translations-in-progress, as well as students who will be starting new projects, are welcome to participate in this workshop.",,CRWR 41504,Instructor consent required.

CRWR 21505,Advanced Translation Workshop: Prose Style. 100 Units.,"Purple, lean, evocative, muscular, literary, exuberant, lucid, stilted, elliptical. These are all labels that critics and reviewers have used to characterize prose styles that call attention to themselves in distinct ways. Of course, what constitutes style not only changes over time, but also means different things in different literary traditions. How, then, do translators carry style over from one language and cultural milieu to another? And to what extent does style structure storytelling? We will explore these questions by reading a variety of modern and contemporary stylists who either write in English or translate into English, paying special attention to what stylistic devices are at work and what their implications are for narration, characterization, and world building. Further, we'll examine the range of choices that each writer and translator makes when constituting and reconstituting style, on a lexical, tonal, and syntactic scale. By pairing readings with generative exercises in stylistics and constrained writing, we will build toward the translation of a short work of contemporary fiction into English. To participate in this workshop, students should be able to comfortably read a literary text in a foreign language.",Winter,CRWR 41505,Open bid through my.uchicago.edu.

CRWR 22117,Advanced Fiction Workshop: Beginning a Novel. 100 Units.,"This workshop is for any student with a novel in progress or an interest in starting one. Our focus will be the opening chapter, arguably the most consequential one-for the reader naturally, but most importantly for us the writer. How might it introduce the people and world of the story, its premise or central conflict, its narrative tone and style? How might it intrigue, orient, or even challenge the reader and begin teaching them how to read the book? And if the first chapter is our actual starting point as the writer, how might it help us figure out the dramatic shape of our novel, its thematic concerns, its conceptual design? We'll apply such questions to the opening chapters of an exemplary mix of novels-The Great Gatsby, The Age of Innocence, Invisible Man, Beloved, The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, The Vegetarian, Normal People, etc.- and examine what they are expected to do as well as what they can unexpectedly do. And as everyone workshops the first chapter (or prologue) of their own novel, we'll consider ways of adjusting or rethinking them so that the author can better understand their project overall and build on all the promise of the material they have.",Autumn,CRWR 42117,,Vu Tran

CRWR 22130,Advanced Fiction Workshop: Inner Logic. 100 Units.,"In this advanced workshop, we will explore the range of strategies and techniques that fiction writers employ to make readers suspend their disbelief. We will consider how imagined worlds are made to feel real and how invented characters can seem so human. We will contemplate how themes, motifs, and symbols are deployed in such a way that a story can feel curated without seeming inorganic. We will consider how hints are dropped with subtlety, how the 'rules' for what is possible in a story are developed, and how writers can sometimes defy their own established expectations in ways that delight rather than frustrate. From character consistency to twist endings, we'll investigate how published authors lend a sense of realism and plausibility to even the most far-fetched concepts. Through regular workshops, we will also interrogate all students' fiction through this lens, discussing the ways in which your narratives-in-progress create their own inner logic. Students will submit two stories to workshop and will be asked to write critiques of all peer work.",Spring,CRWR 42130,"Advanced Workshop: During pre-registration, this course is open only to declared Creative Writing Majors and declared Minors in English and Creative Writing, as well as graduate students.

We'll read stories by authors like Kelly Link, Carmen Maria Machado, and Alice Sola Kim, examining how these writers portray the fantastical and impossible. We'll explore concepts like defamiliarization, versimilitude, and the uncanny. We will contemplate how magical realism and surrealism differ from sci-fi and fantasy genre writing, and ask how we, as writers, can make the quotidian seem extraordinary and the improbable seem inevitable, and to what end? Students will complete several short creative exercises and workshop one story that utilizes magic or strange effects. Students will also be expected to write thoughtful, constructive critiques of peer work.

CRWR 22133,Advanced Fiction Workshop: Writing the Uncanny. 100 Units.,"Sigmund Freud defines ""the uncanny"" (""unheimlich"") as something that unnerves us because it is both familiar and alien at the same time, the result of hidden anxieties and desires coming to the surface. In this advanced fiction workshop, we will explore how fiction writers use the uncanny to create suspense, lend their characters psychological depth, thrill and terrify their readers, and lay bare the darkest and most difficult human impulses. We will read and discuss fiction by writers like Shirley Jackson, Jamaica Kincaid, Octavia Butler, Kelly Link, Ben Okri, Haruki Murakami, and Victor Lavalle, drawing craft lessons from these writers to guide our own attempts at writing the uncanny. Much of our class time will be dedicated to evaluating student work and honing our skills of composition and critique. In addition to shorter writing exercises and ""mini-workshops"" throughout the quarter, every student will complete a full-length ""uncanny"" short story for workshop and compose critique letters for each of their peers.

In this advanced workshop we'll explore the complex ways writers create conflict in their stories, be it internal or external, spiritual or physical, romantic, financial or familial. We'll read masters of the form like Edward P. Jones, George Saunders, ZZ Packer, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Yiyun Li, and discuss how they generate conflict that feels organic, character-driven, and inevitable.

The history of a life can be covered in a sentence, a few pages or seven volumes. How do writers decide? In this advanced workshop, we'll look at different ways to handle narrative time, paying special attention to building blocks like direct and summary scene, flashback, compression, slowed time and fabulist time. We'll examine work by writers whose long stories feel like novels, like Alice Munro and Edward P. Jones, alongside those who say everything in a short single scene of a page or two, like Grace Paley and Kate Chopin. Students will be encouraged to experiment with time in both writing exercises and story revisions.By the end of the course, you will have generated significant raw material and workshopped one story.

CRWR 22140,Advanced Fiction Workshop: Killing Cliché 100 Units.,"It's long been said that there are no new stories, only new ways of telling old ones, but how do writers reengage familiar genres, plots, and themes without being redundant? This course will confront the literary cliché at all levels, from the trappings of genre to predictable turns of plot to the subtly undermining forces of mundane language. We will consider not only how stories can fall victim to cliché but also how they may benefit from calling on recognizable content for the sake of efficiency, familiarity, or homage. Through an array of readings that represent unique concepts and styles as well as more conventional narratives we will examine how published writers embrace or subvert cliché through story craft. Meanwhile, student fiction will be discussed throughout the term in a supportive workshop atmosphere that will aim not to expose clichés in peer work, but to consider how an author can find balance-between the familiar and the unfamiliar, between the predictable and the unpredictable-in order to maximize a story's effect. Students will submit two stories to workshop and will be asked to write critiques of all peer work.",Winter,CRWR 42140,"During pre-registration, this course is open only to declared Creative Writing Majors and declared Minors in English and Creative Writing, as well as graduate students.

CRWR 22146,Advanced Fiction Workshop: Disruption and Disorder. 100 Units.,"This workshop-based course proceeds from the premise that disorder and disruption are fruitful aesthetics that might be applied to numerous elements of fiction to unlock new possibilities in our work. Students will seek to identify typical narrative conventions and lyrical patterns and then write away from them-or write over them, toward subversion, surprise, and perhaps even a productive anarchy. Students will search for hidden structures in work by Taeko Kono, Nafissa Thompson-Spires, Diane Williams, Garielle Lutz, and others, examining the methods these writers use to lead readers to unexpected, original, and transgressive places. Students will complete several short creative exercises in which they practice disruption and disorder in plot, pace, dialogue, and syntax. In the second half of the course, students will workshop one story or excerpt and write thoughtful, constructive critiques of peer work. Revision is also a crucial component of this class, as it is an opportunity to radically warp and deviate from our prior visions.

Writers interested in these torments and luxuries can begin to experiment with long form in this workshop. Each student will compose a single long story of about forty pages. We'll attend to the freshness of beginnings, the satisfactions (and compromises) of endings and, most acutely, to the crises of middles. A scaffolding of workshops, outlines, and conferences will support and structure your efforts. Along the way we'll explore the opportunities of long-form structure with examples from the likes of David Foster Wallace, Alice Munro, Ted Chiang, and Toni Morrison.

CRWR 22150,Advanced Fiction Workshop: Radical Revision. 100 Units.,"Like so many essential and life-sustaining processes-relationship maintenance, money management, digestion-revision is something we often talk about without ""really"" talking about it (to use the words of writer Matthew Salesses). Yet by refusing (or failing) to ""really"" talk about revision, writers deny themselves the opportunity to actively engage with the potentialities of their work: the different shapes, forms, and shifts it might take. In this class, we will demystify the revision process by analyzing the works of writers-such as Anna Kavan, Edwidge Danticat, and Suzanne Scanlon-who have pursued radical revisions to their projects, including expansions (short stories developed into novels), compressions (longer works condensed into shorter pieces), point of view changes, and dramatic stylistic transformations.

CRWR 22152,Advanced Fiction Workshop: Finding and Refining Voice. 100 Units.,"As writers, your ""voice"" is you imposing who you are on the truthfulness of your sentences. Finding your voice, then, is the process-whether you're describing a character, an image, or an idea-of constantly asking yourself, Do I absolutely believe this?, of rewriting and rewriting your sentences until you absolutely do believe it, and finally of refining all the technical aspects you brought to bear to assure that level of individual truth. Out of that, naturally and inevitably, comes your voice-at least for the time being. In this workshop, we'll examine this crucial stage in the development of your own aesthetic, which is not merely a writing style, but more importantly a personal perspective on the world that informs and is informed by that style. We will read a selection of writers with distinctive worldviews and thus distinctive literary voices (Paul Bowles, Toni Morrison, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Lorrie Moore, Ottessa Moshfegh, Ocean Vuong, Garth Greenwell, etc.), and we'll complement those readings with writing exercises and workshops of your own fiction, where you will actively interrogate, cultivate, and refine your emerging voice.",Spring,CRWR 42152,Instructor consent required.

This workshop plumbs those resources to better understand this alternative tradition, studying the craft that can make unruly narrative both highly entertaining and intellectually satisfying, exploring rhetoric, repetition, leitwortstil, logical nesting, suspense, digression, irony, and humor. While executing creative exercises in voice, we'll read books of furious energy by Thomas Bernhard and Jamaica Kincaid alongside cooler, essayistic meanders by W. G. Sebald and Claire-Louise Bennett.

CRWR 22155,Advanced Fiction Workshop: Writing About Work. 100 Units.,"Writing about work, jobs, and vocational experiences may seem contradictory- or even antithetical-to our goals in fiction. After all, if we aim to inspire, to invigorate, to otherwise wield a narrative ""axe for the frozen sea within us"" (as Kafka wrote), why write about the very day-to-day tasks so often charged with numbing and blurring our sensation of life? In this workshop, we will explore and answer this question with our own work-focused fictions, developing strategies for defamiliarizing the mundane, and using routines to build dramatic tension. Utilizing a combination of creative workshops and exercises-and drawing upon models from the job-focused fiction of Eugene Martin, Dorothy Allison, Lucia Berlin, Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah, Edwidge Danticat, and other writers-we will also deepen and develop our characters through precise depictions of their work environments.",Spring,CRWR 42155,"Advanced Workshop: During pre-registration, this course is open only to declared Creative Writing Majors and declared Minors in English and Creative Writing, as well as graduate students.

CRWR 22156,Advanced Fiction Workshop: Narrator as Personality. 100 Units.,"While aspiring writers usually grasp quickly how to write direct dialog-we hear it all around us, in public and private spaces-narration is a trickier enterprise. In this writing workshop, we will look at the narrator as personality, a voice that exists to tell the story, but not always to enter it. The narrator can be a constant, like an elbow in the side, or effaced, touching down to only give us the basics of time and place. They can be all knowing, summarizing scenes, people and events from a distant, God-like vantage, or reportorial, speaking in present tense as events unfurl. Some narrators make us laugh but are conning us with their charm; others explain the psychology of events like a great therapist or moralize like a member of the clergy. We will read a wide range of examples from writers like Edward P. Jones, Anton Chekhov, Salman Rushdie, Amy Hempel, Yiyun Li, and Louise Erdrich. Students will be encouraged to experiment in both writing exercises and story revisions.

We'll discuss the art of brevity-including related forms like the aphorism, the note, and the joke. We'll begin in experiment and end with substantial compositions. Our readings will be drawn from the numerous contemporary novelists who use this method (Jenny Offill, Olga Ravn, Dorthe Nors) as well as the older generation of authors who, in their different ways, may be said to have pioneered the form (Marguerite Duras, Gwendolyn Brooks, William Gass, Renata Adler).

CRWR 22158,Advanced Fiction Workshop: From the Ground Up. 100 Units.,"In a craft talk, writer Stephen Dobyns once described an exercise he used for generating stories inspired by Raymond Carver, who said about his process, ""I write the first sentence, and then I write the next sentence and then the next."" Apparently, Dobyns was frustrated by that answer, but later challenged himself to write 50 first sentences of potential stories. Then, he picked half of them and wrote 25 first paragraphs. From those, he eventually completed about a half dozen stories. (I learned this from an article by the great short story writer Kelly Link.) In this generative workshop, we will proceed in this fashion. During the first week, we'll study the first sentences of stories and each write our own 50 first sentences. During the second week, we'll study the first paragraphs of stories and each write 25 first paragraphs, and so on until all students have a few complete drafts of stories, one of which will be submitted to our in-class workshop. Along the way, we'll read and discuss well-made stories by writers such as Kelly Link, Denis Johnson, Joy Williams, Edward P. Jones, Justin Torres, Mary Gaitskill, and many others.

In this advanced fiction workshop, we'll examine fiction about family friction with an eye for observing the strategies that authors have used to construct dramas that revolve around how families love, cope, or crumple in the midst of crisis. As we identify tropes of family dysfunction, we'll also consider the ways authors use narrative devices like point-of-view, setting, plot, and scene to investigate how we define family (and how those definitions have evolved); its bonds and intergenerational inheritances; how families-like institutions- are bonded by their distinctive habits, manners, mores, and laws; and how kinship might magnify, subvert, or critique larger society. Above all, we'll debate what family life and family strife teach us about storytelling.

At the most intimate scale, we will consider how poetry can cultivate critical awareness of the present moment amidst forces that pull us with dopamine-induced promises and regrets into the future and past. How does poetry, with its odd ability to punctuate, syncopate, fragment, and suspend time, intervene in daily life and in the historical record?

As poets, we'll use, misuse, and borrow from science in our poems. We'll approach poems like science experiments and aim to enter an ""experimental attitude."" From a practical point of view, we'll try to write poems that incorporate the language of science to freshen their own language or to expand the realm of poetic diction. Furthermore, we'll work with tropes and procedural experiments that may result in revelation, discovery, and surprise. Readings may include work by Aimé Césaire, Kimiko Hahn, Ed Roberson, Dean Young, Joyelle Mcsweeney, and Will Alexander. Students can expect to write several poems, participate in discussion forums with both initial response papers and follow-up comments, critique peers' work, and submit a final portfolio.

CRWR 23136,Advanced Poetry Workshop: Poetry as Parasite. 100 Units.,"Might there be a kind of poem that acts like a parasite latched on to a host body? A poem whose very life is the fusion of various sources, voices, discourses? This poetry workshop invites students to read and write poetry that, either overtly or subtly, engages with other texts. We'll examine ways that poems create intertextual relationships (e.g. quoting, voicing, alluding, echoing, stealing, sampling, imitating, translating…) and test out these methods in our own writing. Students should expect to engage with the basic question of how their work relates to other poets and poems. Expect to read a substantial amount of work by modern and contemporary poets, submit new original poems for workshop, complete intertextual writing exercises, participate in discussion forums with both initial response papers and follow-up comments, critique peers' work, and submit a final portfolio.

CRWR 23137,"Advanced Poetry Workshop: Poetry, Archives, and History. 100 Units.","This course introduces fundamental ideas about poetic form and approaches to poetic writing through close reading and discussion of poetry (modern and contemporary but not exclusively). We will consider poetic elements from the ground-up-reading closely for sound, image, syntax, and meaning-in order to enliven those elements in student writing. Likewise, we will consider how poems appear at a crossroads between history and experience (the past and present) in order to inspire students to write not only about themselves but about real and imagined social, cultural, historical, and intellectual locations and horizons (considering such aspects of poetry writing as geography, history, mythology, anthropology, kinship, science, visual media, audio media, etc). We will do so in conversation with our peers by way of regular presentations and workshops, in which students will give feedback to one another's works, learning thus how to read critically while generously, and how to respond collegially while also constructively. At the end of the quarter students will revise drafts based on class writing exercises and workshop conversations, to produce a portfolio prefaced by a critical reflection. The arc of the class also involves the making of a collaborative syllabus (with a wide range of texts offered and guided by the instructor but available to the creative configuration of the students themselves), to strengthen our grasp of archival and curatorial aspects of poetry writing.",Autumn,CRWR 43137,Open bid through my.uchicago.edu.

The group's aim is to use constraints and procedures to create new literary forms. (""Oulipo"" is an acronym that stands for Workshop or Sewing Circle of Potential Literature.) In a similar spirit of playful experiment, we will take a hands-on approach, with students composing new drafts each week. We will experiment with a variety of methods, ranging from traditional verse forms to concrete poetry; creative translations; re-writing; erasures; collages; documentary and research-based poetics; site-specific and ritual poetry; incorporating film, sound, image; and a selection of stimulating Oulipian constraints (e.g. only using certain letters or writing three versions of the same poem, etc.). As we workshop students' drafts, we will discuss topics including inspiration, authorship, form, copying and plagiarism; poetry, activism, and social justice; and the idea of ""fact"" in poetry.

We will ask ourselves about artifice and making, the materiality of the written word, the relationship between observation and expression, the emotive qualities of the image, and the sonic qualities of words. Most of our course reading will be contemporary poetry, but we will also explore a range of exciting earlier examples. Each class meeting will include workshops of student poems, discussions of assigned literature, and conversations about art practice and art community. In addition to reading deeply, looking closely, and writing wildly, students are expected to be lively participants in the arts community on campus, and will attend exhibitions, concerts, readings, screenings, and other events and experiences that bring us into contact with various modes of expression.

Our own present moment is defined by a convergence of climate and ecological crises, refugee crisis, food crisis, war, and epidemic. In this workshop, we will examine poetic writing arising out of crises, whether political, artistic, or existential, and craft poems that attempt to deal with crisis - both in the form of a concrete Event, and as a literary trope - through critical creative engagement, experimentation, and intertextual dialogue. Readings may include work by Peter Balakian, Jericho Brown, Don Mee Choi, Jorie Graham, Ilya Kaminsky, Valzhyna Mort, Claudia Rankine, Ocean Vuong, as well as classical sources.

Because hesitance, fragment, the ever- presence of history, and notions of closure come into play whenever ghosts and others returning from beyond make visitations, our conversation will inevitably turn to the question of the openness of text, and in addition to gothic themes, we will examine form and strategy to wonder together how language turns and returns upon itself like the vampire that rises again and again in various shape-shifting guises. What is natural? What is unnatural? What is supernatural? How do the inexplicable and the explicable meet in poems?

Never before, writes Elizabeth Rush, have humans been here to tell the story of collapse, extinction, adaptation, and memory. In this workshop, we will read and write eco-memoir, a hybrid form of literary nonfiction that blends the work of ecology, history, and personal narrative to understand more fully how memory is bound to ecosystems. Some might simply call this memoir, following J. Drew Lanham's view that the writing of memoir is also the writing of environment. This course will ask how the memoirist looks at place, taking up W.G. Sebald's thinking that places seem to ""have some kind of memory, in that they activate memory in those who look at them."" Students will practice using the tenets of literary memoir-writing to engage with the theoretical frameworks of such environmental thinkers as Donna Haraway and Jedidiah Purdy. We will ask: to what extent is remembering a collective act? How might the eco-memoir represent the uneven consequences of ecological disruption? What narrative structures does the story of an ecosystem take? Students will write two-full length essays or memoir chapters.

Many trauma survivors begin writing reluctantly, even repulsed by the impulse to query their woundedness. The process is inhibited by stigma surrounding the notion of victimhood, entities that would prefer a survivor's silence, plus our tendency to dismiss and devalue ones suffering in relation to others. Students in this class will shed some of these constricting patterns of thinking about trauma so they may freely explore their stories with confidence, compassion, curiosity, and intention. We'll read authors who have found surprise, nuance, and yes, healing through art, honoring the heart-work that happens behind the scenes. Half of class-time will include student-led workshops of original works in progress. Paramount to our success will be an atmosphere of safety, supportiveness, respect, and confidentiality.

CRWR 24022,Advanced Nonfiction Workshop: Writing Beyond the Event. 100 Units.,"Much of the tradition of Western storytelling relies on scene-driven narratives propelled by rising action toward an inevitable apex. Often natural disasters are illustrated the same way: hurricanes, invasion of new species, infectious disease, and oil spills are cast as singular events with a beginning, middle and end. This advanced workshop will explore how to push beyond the event. We will examine how forms of nonfiction, from investigative journalism to lyric essays, push against the hegemony of the ""event"" to tell a longer, slower story of disruption across the nexus of time and space. Following Rob Nixon's concept of slow violence, readings will focus on places and communities whose narratives do not fit tidily into beginning-middle-end story structures.

In this class, students will search their lives for events and lessons which they may consider formative, together evaluating the standards they use to qualify rites of passage, in order to isolate unique patterns of growth that students can call their own. Half the quarter will be dedicated to discussing original student work. A multitude of possibilities will be offered by readings of contemporary memoirists from all walks of life.

Through readings and in-class exercises, we'll explore tenets of the personal essay, like narrative structure and pacing, alongside considerations of voice and vulnerability. After a brief historical survey, we'll look to contemporary essayists as our guides--writers like Billy-Ray Belcourt, Melissa Faliveno, Saeed Jones, Richard Rodriguez, and T. Fleischmann-- alongside more familiar writers like Alison Bechdel and Maggie Nelson. And through student-led workshops, we'll wrestle with concerns that often trouble narratives of otherness: What does it mean to write a personal narrative that has a potential social impact?

In this workshop, we read some of those writers and critics. And we read illustrative examples of contemporary feminist biography (and anti-biography) in various nonfiction genres, including magazine profile, trade book, Wiki article, audio performance, personal essay, cult pamphlet, avant-garde art piece. Mostly, we try out the form for ourselves, in our own writing. Each workshop writer will choose a biographical subject (single, collective, or otherwise), and work up a series of sketches around that subject. By the end of the quarter, workshop writers will build these sketches into a single piece of longform life-writing.

The world's stadiums and arenas have become theaters of very real battles over race and gender, class and religion, colonialism and social justice. At the same time, the games themselves have also changed in fascinating and telling ways. This workshop invites writers who are curious about sports as a subject for literary exploration. We examine the subject through various genres of nonfiction, from longform journalism to personal essay to audio storytelling.

Home to the Palace of Westminster, where parliament has assembled since the thirteenth century, it has also been a site of protest, petitions and revolutionary action for democratic change. The center of political power in the British Empire, London was a focal point of struggles for national self-determination. It was also a site of exile for revolutionaries, radicals and democrats who found sanctuary and spaces to organize underground networks of resistance to the regimes they fled. This dynamic history has left a rich archival treasure trove, from the official transcripts of Parliament's famous orators, to the seventeenth century pamphleteers of the English Revolution who imagined a 'world turned upside down', the secret diaries and letters written by hunger-striking suffragette prisoners, and much else besides.

DEMS 18101,Democracy in America? 100 Units.,"Is the United States a democracy? Has it ever been? Why has the concept of democracy-as genuine ideal or false idol-been so central to Americans' self-understanding, and so constitutive of their politics? Throughout its past, the United States has been defined by endless and unpredictable struggles to establish and extend self-government of one kind or another-even as those struggles have encountered great resistance and relied on the exclusion or subordination of some portion of society to underwrite expanding freedom and equality for those enjoying the fullest benefits of citizenship. Indeed, for most of US history the right to self-government was not exercised by most people, and its denial was at times justified in the name of openly undemocratic ideals, including elite wisdom, male prerogative, slavery, empire, and economic efficiency. The enemies of democracy have been just as determined as-and perhaps better endowed than-its advocates. Yet at critical junctures in US history, citizenship and political life have expanded to articulate the meaning and practice of self-government anew. In this class we will critically examine these junctures using empirical case studies and classic works of US political philosophy in order to uncover the historical realities lurking behind enduring statements of democratic principle.",Spring,"HIST 18101, LLSO 28101",1st and 2nd years get preference,J.

Beginning with an overview of the present crises and significant actors on the world stage, we will then examine the political setting for the United Nations' approval of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights in 1948. The post-World War 2 period was a period of optimism and fertile ground for the establishment of a universal rights regime, given the defeat of fascism in Europe. International jurists wanted to establish a framework of rights that went beyond the nation-state, taking into consideration the partitions of India-Pakistan and Israel-Palestine - and the rising expectations of African-Americans in the U.S. and colonized peoples across Africa and Asia. But from the beginning, there were basic contradictions in a system of rights promulgated by representatives of nation-states that ruled colonial regimes, maintained de facto and de jure systems of racial discrimination, and imprisoned political dissidents and journalists. Cross-cutting themes of the course include the universalism of human rights, problems of impunity and accountability, notions of ""exceptionalism,"" and the emerging issue of the ""shamelessness"" of authoritarian regimes.

DEMS 21005,Militant Democracy and the Preventative State. 100 Units.,"Are states of exception still exceptional? The current debates and developments as well as the existential governmental crises has led to a securitization of rights. State security discourse narrates how states understand and mediate their legal obligations and has been used justify pre-emptive actions and measures which otherwise would not fit within an international law framework. When narrated in the public square, States often construct a discourse around a necessity defence-measures that may be extra-legal but argued to be necessary to protect democratic values and the democratic 'way of life.' This typifies what we refer to as 'militant democratic' language of the 'preventive state' and has been most visible in the raft of antiterrorism measures that were introduced after the events of September 11, 2001 and remain to date. This course will examine the impact of militant democracy and the preventative state on the current human rights landscape.

DEMS 24700,Organizing Coalitions for Change: Growing Power and Social Movements. 100 Units.,"Coalitions are building blocks of social movements, often bringing people together across race, class, faith and ethnicity to build the power required to make social change. Coalitions address local, state, national and international policies, public and private sector matters. They are employed successfully, or not, from the far left to the far right. They vary widely, engaging people from very grassroots and local communities to civic, faith, labor, business, and political leadership. At times spontaneously precipitated, at times methodically built, effective coalitions can change the fundamental relationships in our society, change society and challenge what we know or think we know. This course will examine the conceptual models of diverse coalitions formed to impact social, legal, and political structures. We will explore the strengths and limitations of coalitions, and their impact upon low-income and oppressed communities. We will study recent examples to stop public housing displacement, end police misconduct, halt deportations, and seek fair tax reform.

DEMS 25563,Does American Democracy Need Religion? 100 Units.,"In the United States, we find ourselves living as part of a democracy. But that simple fact doesn't necessarily make us fans of democracy by default. In fact, it leaves many questions unanswered: Is democracy a good thing? If so, why and on what grounds? Why should you or I value democracy and its ideals (e.g., equality, liberty, fraternity)? If we do, what (if anything) grounds our devotion to this shared political tradition? And does, can, or should religion have a role to play? In this course, we will explore American democracy as a normative tradition and its relationship to various religious traditions in American society. Through examining key interpreters of American democracy such as Danielle Allen, Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Jr., Cornel West, Joshua Abraham Heschel, and Amanda Gorman, we will approach the question of how religion and democracy relate to one another. We'll investigate the relative independence of democracy and religion, focusing on philosophers and poets who emphasize American democracy as tradition in its own right. We will also consider ""Civil Religion in America,"" through the work of sociologists and historians who suggest the dependence of the democratic on religion or something like it. Finally, we'll question the relative interdependence of American democracy and religious traditions by turning to claims of influential religious and political leaders and activists.

DEMS 25900,Digitizing Human Rights. 100 Units.,"In an era in which disruptive technologies have hijacked our consciousness and computer code has woven itself into the fabric of our existence, the lines between the virtual and the physical are increasingly blurred, and the nature of human existence itself increasingly uncertain. Digitizing Human Rights invites you to ponder, question, and even reshape the future of the species. We'll consider digital surveillance, data consent, access to tech, online agency, algorithmic bias and the future of artificial intelligence, among other topics. Drawing on cross-disciplinary perspectives, the course aims to illuminate the often misunderstood aspects of the digital age with the goal of creating an annotated digital document to serve as a blueprint for steering humanity towards a more equitable and just -- and perhaps a more secure -- future. Annotations will draw on a broad array of philosophical traditions and contextualize current issues and debates. We will also problematize the document itself to build into our work a consideration of the digital form through which we are thinking and representing claims about humanity, morality, truth, and justice, for example, that are entailed in the project of ""human rights."" The class will meet both in small groups and the larger seminar to refine the provisions and annotations, review progress, and shape the document as a whole.",,"MADD 25900, BPRO 25900, HMRT 25900",,

Students will evaluate these questions by examining how different models of government oversight work in practice. The quarter will be split attention between federal and local government structures and oversight mechanisms. At the federal level, we will discuss special prosecutors, inspector general audits, models of judicial review and oversight, and the transformation of oversight institutions in the Trump era. At the local level, our focus will be on policing as a government function uniquely in need of effective oversight and uniquely difficult to oversee effectively. As a ""windows"" course, this course will ask students to engage in class discussions and written assignments with current, real-world challenges facing government oversight professionals.",Winter,PBPL 26080,,Robert Owens

DEMS 27908,"Tocqueville in America, from Then to Now. 100 Units.","Ever since Alexis de Tocqueville visited the United States during the Jacksonian Era, his account of what he saw there, _Democracy in America_, has become a kind of latter-day founding document to which Americans turn again and again to understand themselves and their past. Although he was an aristocrat manqué and a failed politician-or perhaps because of it-Tocqueville saw into the heart of democratic society as it had advanced in North America, for better and for worse. In the decades since, generations of commentators and intellectuals have returned to his insights to develop an account of what makes democracy in America distinctive, and what ties it to the broader currents of the unfolding modern world. To explore this rich palimpsest of insight we will read Tocqueville's masterpiece along with the contemporary and subsequent responses to it that have inscribed his analysis indelibly into the American political tradition. Coursework will culminate in an independent research project on the legacy of Tocqueville in America.",Winter,"HIST 27908, FNDL 27908, SIGN 27908, AMER 27908, LLSO 27908, ENGL 27908",,J. Sparrow & E.

Why are some countries democratic and others are dictatorships, and what determines switching between regimes? Does democracy matter for health, wealth, and happiness? Why are some countries beset by civil violence and revolution whereas others are politically stable? Why do political parties organize themselves politically around ethnicity, language, religion, or ideology? This course explores these and other similar questions that lie at the core of comparative politics. Drawing on political science, economics, sociology, and anthropology, while utilizing a wealth of data and case studies of major countries, we will examine how power is exercised to shape and control political, cultural, and economic institutions and, in turn, how these institutions generate policies that affect what we learn, what we earn, how long we live, and even who we are.",Autumn,PLSC 28901,,"M.

In this course, we will explore a range of representations and practices related to ""repair"" in China, thinking about how we might repair our understanding of ourselves and of our relation to the world. Our first task will be to unpack basic concepts--repair, environment, nature, world--in relation to one another. We will consider literary, philosophical, and artistic works that question the notion that humans are separate from nature or the environment, and will study the specific means whereby different literary and visual genres call attention to elements--plants, water, air, earth, humans--in need of repair. Throughout the course, we will ask the following questions: How do we orient ourselves toward repair as a mode of living? What would our daily life look like-how would it change--if it were guided by the aspiration to repair rather than by the desire to progress, expand, extract, and conquer? What can help generate the wish to repair? Our materials will include ancient Chinese philosophical and literary texts and landscape paintings; Chinese contemporary literary works, artworks, and documentary films; and theoretical texts in environmental humanities.

To this end, beyond issues of fictional representation, we will work to parse the relation between queer as an identity or subject position (queer people/characters) and queer as a set of interpretive strategies and ethical orientations to cultural texts (queer critique). In the first half of the quarter, we will examine some of this recent fiction alongside queer literary criticism and theory, and hold in-class workshops to conceptualize together the ""queer"" in queer literature and learn about the current situation of queer activism and cultural production in East Asia. In the second half of the quarter, we will read further East Asian literature through several thematic clusters - family, fandom, desire, etc. - while applying the interpretive approaches we learned in the first.

Yet, what we easily call macro-level or meta-narratives feels too heavy to lift. We will try to learn how to fill the gap between abstract and concrete and try to understand history as something specific and commonplace: Everyday. Using modern Korea as a lens, this course will address topics related to everyday-from what we do everyday (housing, eating, and clothes) to how we do everyday (earning, spending, meeting, thinking, feeling, etc.) How does food reflect the history of any society's culture? What historical situations have created so-called ""the Apartment Republic"" in South Korea? Why did the Korean public become crazy about dancing in the 1950s?

By closely looking at a variety of cases, we will consider: How does performance provide us alternative lens to probe into the changing cultural values, historical backgrounds, and social identities in East Asia?

We will read and analyze women's economic engagements in different contexts and localities (e.g. factories, households, political mobilizations, global trade, and sex work) together with scholarships from socio-economic historians, anthropologists, and feminist scholars. Historians have provided a broad chronological framework and empirical studies, such as the birth of feminist movements in twentieth-century East Asia, the pattern of gendered and highly specialized economic development, and women's work as handicraft makers, factory employers, and sex workers. Anthropologists have established such analytical categories as ""skill,"" ""practical knowledge,"" and ""gynotechnics"" that were largely overlooked when discussing women's work. Recent Marxist feminist scholars have extended Marxist examination of value to female labor, and contributed to our understanding of social reproduction by theorizing capitalism and its supporting system.

This will be done both with an eye to the historical continuity of these sometimes seemingly contradictory forms thought and practice, and also to extract from them whatever transhistorical philosophical and spiritual valences we care to derive from the texts.",Autumn,"DVPR 32402, EALC 32401, HREL 32400, RLST 22401",,Brook Ziporyn
EALC 22402,Japanese Zen Buddhism. 100 Units.,"What is Zen? Impossibly, seemingly, everything to everybody. In this course, we will explore Zen's protean transformations through a close reading of primary sources in translation. Rather than asking what Zen is, we will focus on how in these materials the Zen traditions are continually de/re-constructed as contingent religious identities from medieval Japan to the contemporary United States and Europe. The focus of the course will be the premodern Japanese Zen tradition, its background in Chinese Chan, and its reception in the West. The course will include field trips to Zen communities in the Chicago area.

EALC 23001,Censorship in East Asia: The Case of Colonial Korea. 100 Units.,"Looking into the intricate workings and profound impact of state publication control in the Japanese Empire during the first half of the twentieth century, this seminar examines how censorship influenced literary and other forms of publication within the Korean colony. Students analyze the manipulation of information and representation by engaging with a diverse array of primary sources, including literature, periodicals, police reports, censors' documents, posters, and postcards, among others. Not only do they seek a nuanced understanding of censorship and its impact on cultural production engaging themselves with the original materials from colonial Korea, but also do they gain a broad historical knowledge of modern Korea under Japanese rule and further East Asia under Japan's dominance and hegemony. Throughout the course, focus is placed upon manuscript (""pre-publication"") censorship.

EALC 23201,Confucian Philosophy and Spirituality. 100 Units.,"The goal of this course is to introduce you to the central themes and texts of classical Confucian and Neo-Confucian traditions, both as philosophical works to be evaluated and digested for their doctrinal content and as literary artifacts from a perhaps unfamiliar cultural sphere. This will call for the development of two distinct but related sets of skills, namely, the ability to think through and comprehend philosophical arguments and ideas, and the equally crucial ability to reflect on one's own assumptions as they come into play in one's reaction to and evaluation of those ideas. Readings will include, from the classical period, the Four Books (Great Learning, Doctrine of the Mean, Analects of Confucius, Mencius), Xunzi, the Book of Changes, and from Sung-Ming Neo-Confucian writings of Zhou Dunyi, Zhang Zai, the Cheng Brothers, Zhu Xi and Wang Yangming.",Autumn,"RLST 23001, EALC 33201, HREL 33001, DVPR 33001",,Brook Ziporyn
EALC 23202,"Li Zhi and 16th Century China: The Self, Tradition, and Dissent in Comparative Context. 100 Units.","The 16th century Chinese iconoclast Li Zhi (Li Zhuowu) has been rightly celebrated as a pioneer of individualism, one of history's great voices of social protest, an original mind powerfully arguing for genuine self-expression, and more. He was a Confucian official and erudite in the classics, yet in his sixties he takes the Buddhist tonsure, and late in life befriends the Jesuit Matteo Ricci. He sought refuge in a quiet monastery devoting his life to scholarship, yet invited constant scandal. His A Book to Burn ""sold like hotcakes,"" and attracted enough trouble that reportedly readers would surreptitiously hide their copies tucked up their sleeves, and was later banned by the state soon after his death. In this seminar, we will place Li both within the context of the history of ""Confucian"" thought, and within the literary, religious, and philosophical conversations of the late Ming. Using his writings as a productive case study, we will think about topics including ""religion,"" tradition and innovation, ""spontaneity"" and ""authenticity,"" and the relationship between ""classics"" and commentaries. Throughout, we will bring our discussions into comparative analysis, considering views of thinkers and traditions from other times and places.

Of special interest will be the role played by Bergsonian ideas in the Yogacara revival and the formation of New Confucianism during this period, with particular focus on figures like Zhang Taiyan, Xiong Shili and Liang Shumin. This will require us to deeply engage Bergson's idea of ""duration"" (durée) and its interpretation, particularly in relation to a reconsideration of the Yogacara Buddhist notion of ālaya-consciousness (storehouse consciousness) and the Confucian idea of ceaseless generation and regeneration (shengsheng bu xi) as derived from interpretive traditions centered on the Book of Changes (Yijing).",Autumn,"DVPR 33908, HREL 33908, RLST 23908, FNDL 23908, EALC 33908",,Brook Ziporyn
EALC 24120,Chinese Thought and The Good Life. 100 Units.,"This course examines the ideas of thinkers with vastly different responses to the question: What is the life well lived? In our study, we will focus on early China (5th century to 221 BCE), a seminal and vibrant period in Chinese thought. Some thinkers (such as ""Laozi"") argue the good life is the simple one, others (Xunzi) insist that it is the life of achieved great intellectual, aesthetic, or moral ambition. Yet others argue that central to the life well lived are rich, nuanced, and strong ties to family (Confucius), acting on one's developed intuitions (Mengzi), or developing one's capacity to play in the moment whatever the circumstances (Zhuangzi). Two thinkers we will study focus on the means for making the social world supportive of a life that is good. Hanfeizi argues for the importance of well-defined, objective, enforced laws. Sunzi illuminates the art of war. We will explore topics such as notions of the self, conceptions of the greater cosmos, the role of rituals, ideas about human nature, and the tension between tradition and self-expression. The course includes lectures, class discussions, self-designed spiritual exercises, creating a class ""Commentary"" on the Analects, essays of varied lengths, and writers' circles.",Autumn,"KNOW 24115, RLST 24115",,Pauline Lee

This course explores the history of food in Japan in the period from c. 1600 to the postwar era. Topics to be examined include changing practices of consumption and production, medical discourse and conceptions of a proper diet, the impact of introduction of new foods and new methods of preparation, the rise of nutritional science, the development of a ""national cuisine,"" and the impact of war and defeat upon food culture.",Spring,"EALC 34123, HIST 24123, HIST 34123",,S.

After Japan declared defeat on August 15th, 1945, the empire has officially ended. Yet, the aftermath and afterlife of Japan's empire still deeply influenced the social and political environment in this region.

EALC 24256,"Everyday Maoism: Revolution, Daily Life, and Material Culture in Socialist China. 100 Units.","The history of Maoist China is usually told as a sequence of political campaigns, from land reform to the Cultural Revolution. Yet for the majority of the Chinese population, the promise of socialism was as much about material transformations as it was about political change: a socialist revolution would bring better living conditions, new work regimes and new consumption patterns. If we want to understand what socialism meant for different groups of people, we have to look at the ""new objects"" of socialist modernity, at changes in dress codes and apartment layouts, at electrification and city planning - or at the persistence of an older material life under a new socialist veneer. In this course, we will analyze workplaces in order to understand how socialism changed the way people worked, and look at rationing and consumption in the households to see how socialism affected them at home. We will look at how specific objects came to stand in for the Maoist revolution, for socialist modernity, or for feudal backwardness. The course has a strong comparative dimension: we will read some of the literature on socialism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, to see how Chinese socialism differed from its cousins. Another aim is methodological. How can we understand the lives of people who wrote little and were rarely written about? To which extent can we read people's life experiences out of the material record of their lives?",Spring,HIST 24512,MA students can take with instructor's permission.,J. Eyferth

EALC 24455,New Histories of Chinese Labor. 100 Units.,"Past scholarship has often reduced the history of Chinese labor to the history of the Chinese labor movement or the history of the Communist Party in its function as ""the leading core"" of the proletariat. The factory proletariat, of course, was never more than a small segment of the Chinese labor force - less than five percent under the Republic, less than ten in the People's Republic. Recent work has been more inclusive, looking at work outside the formal sector, in agriculture, handcrafts, and service industries; at the work of women in formal employment and at home; at sex work and emotional work; at unemployment and precarious work; at the work of internal migrants; at Chinese workers abroad; at coerced work in private industry (the 2007 ""kiln slaves' incident""); and at carceral labor in Xinjiang and elsewhere. Most of the readings will deal with work in the Mao and post-Mao years, right up to the present. We will combine readings on Chinese labor history with more general texts on the relationship between productive and reproductive work, wage work and non-wage work, male and female work, autonomous and heteronomous work. The guiding question throughout the course is if a new Chinese labor movement is necessary, possible, or probable, and if it is not, under which conditions it might become so.",Spring,"HIST 24306, EALC 34455, HIST 34306",,J.

EALC 24501,Women and Work in Modern East Asia. 100 Units.,"Worldwide, women do about 75 percent of the world's unpaid care and domestic work. They spend up to three hours more per day cooking and cleaning than men do, and anywhere from two to ten hours more per day looking after children and the elderly. Women's underpaid work at home and in industry subsidized the early stages of industrialization in nineteenth-century Britain, early twentieth-century Japan, and contemporary China, and women's unpaid contributions to their households enable employers worldwide to keep wages low. We know, at least in outline, how women came to carry double burdens in Europe and North America, but little research has been done so far about this process in East Asia. In this course, we will discuss when and how China, Japan, and Korea developed a division of labor in which most wage work was gendered male and reproductive work was marked female. Are current divisions of labor between men and women rooted in local cultures, or are they the result of industrial capitalist development? How do divisions of labor differ between the three East Asian countries, and how did developments in one East Asian country affect others?",Winter,"HIST 34518, EALC 34501, GNSE 30121, HIST 24518, GNSE 20121",,Jacob Eyferth

There may never have been a time when Taiwan's future was so heatedly debated, or viewed as so central to global politics, as it is at this moment.

The aim of this seminar is to historicize and critically question this seemingly natural intimacy, for while it certainly cannot be denied that the various Buddhist traditions have always had on offer a plethora of techniques for mental (and physical) cultivation, it is far from clear how or even if all these could be subsumed under the in its current usage relatively recent category of ""meditation"". Drawing on Buddhist meditation literature from various traditions, historical periods, and literary genre, in this seminar we will take up a twofold question: First, how has the encounter with Buddhist techniques of cultivation shaped the modern understanding of ""meditation"", and second, up to which extend, and at what cost, has this very modern understanding conversely conditioned us to see Buddhism as a ""meditative religion"" par excellence?",Spring,"HREL 34600, HIST 24122, SALC 34600, RLST 24600, HIST 34122, SALC 24600, EALC 34600",,Stephan Licha

EALC 25840,Philosophical Approaches to Peace of Mind: The Zhuangzi in Dialogue. 100 Units.,"Philosophical activity across cultures and times has been closely associated with the management of affective states. One common goal is to minimize negative emotions by changing how events are interpreted and appraised. This course will focus on three strategies that appear across different traditions. The first argues that events are outside of our control, in some cases appealing to fate but in other cases appealing to chance. The second strategy is a skeptical approach that attacks our ability to judge any event as bad or good. The third strategy undermines the ontological status of the kinds of things we become attached to, either by rejecting the ultimate reality of individual substances or arguing that diverse things form a single whole. All of these strategies appear prominently in the classical Chinese text the Zhuangzi. The core of this course will consist of a close reading of parts of the Zhuangzi, considering these strategies as they intersect with and shed light on its various philosophies. We will also read in a comparative context. The other traditions used will be guided by student interest, but the most likely choices would be Stoicism and Epicureanism (for the first strategy), Sextus Empiricus (for the second), and arguments appearing South Asian Buddhist philosophies (for the third). Aside from better understanding the Zhuangzi, the goal of the course is to consider how similar strategies function in significantly different cultural contexts.",Spring,"HREL 35840, EALC 35840, DVPR 35840, KNOW 35840, RLST 25840",,Frank Perkins

We will also be looking at printed maps from the Edo period (1600-1868) and single-sheet ephemera, and we will be considering questions such as the role of censorship, the differences between wood-block printing and typography and why people continued to produce manuscripts during the age of print.

ECON 12300,Character and Commerce: Practical Wisdom in Economic Life. 100 Units.,"Most of us seek to be reasonably good people leading what we take to be successful and satisfying lives. There is a mountain of evidence suggesting that most of us fail to live up to our own standards. Worse, we often fail to mark our own failures in ways that could help us improve ourselves. The context in which we try to live good lives is shaped by the vicissitudes of the global economy. The global economy is obviously of interest to those of us studying economics or planning on careers in business. Aspiring entrepreneurs or corporate leaders have clear stakes in understanding practical wisdom in the economic sphere. But anyone who relies upon her pay - or someone else's - to cover her living expenses has some interest in economic life. In this course, we will bring work in neo-Aristotelian ethics and neo-classical economics into conversation with empirical work from behavioral economics and behavioral ethics, to read, write, talk, and think about cultivating wisdom in our economic dealings. While our focus will be on business, the kinds of problems we will consider, and the ways of addressing these, occur in ordinary life more generally - at home, in academic settings, and in our efforts to participate in the daily production and reproduction of sound modes of social interaction.

Are countries in competition with one another, making one a winner and another a loser, or is trade mutually beneficial? Who gains and who loses from international trade within a country? Should high-wage countries be worried about competition from low-wage countries? Is international trade the main cause of increasing U.S. wage inequality?

BUSN 20940,Business Ethics. 100 Units.,"Students in this course will gain experience formulating coherent arguments about the ethics and role of business, by relating their own views to important ideas about business, democracy and markets. We will use this approach to consider a broad range of tradeoffs and controversies that business leaders often confront. The business environment creates ethical choices that can be hard to think through clearly. It can also subject companies to negative publicity or political pressure, which affects both how they are regulated and how well they attract employees, customers and partners. Business leaders are often called upon to make credible and persuasive arguments defending their products, their firms, their industries, or the capitalist or market system in which they operate. The quality and accuracy of arguments in this environment vary, but usually include assertions that a business or its leaders are behaving unethically or lack legitimacy. The ability to assess these claims, and to address them effectively when you think the facts and arguments are on your side, is a crucial skill, especially given the extensive influence of governments, pressure groups and the media. This course requires students to consider how their views on the role and conduct of business relate to the ideas of important thinkers, and to apply their views to business settings by discussing controversial topics or decisions.",Spring,,"Prerequisite(s): This course is not open to MBA students.

ENGL 10134,Gertrude Stein. 100 Units.,"The singular modernist writer Gertrude Stein once claimed that she invented 20th century English by reinventing the sentence, a reinvention that sounds like her famous quip ""A rose is a rose is a rose."" This course starts from that claim as a provocation: what kind of prose style can Stein claim to have ""invented,"" who followed her in using these new sentences, and what kinds of political, philosophical, and literary changes revolved around the English sentence? We'll ask these questions as we read across Stein's idiosyncratic body of writing and its complex relationship to her modernist contemporaries and the later 20th century writers she influenced. Stein was neither strictly novelist nor poet nor critic, but sometimes all three, other times none of the above; she was in a long term, open-secret lesbian partnership at the turn of the 20th century, a lifelong American expat to Paris, ambivalently Jewish, a fascinated and problematic critic of race relations. She was also a prolific art collector and, more importantly, people collector. In addition to reading key works by Stein, other writers and artists we might look at include William James, Bertrand Russell, Alfred North Whitehead, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Richard Wright, Ernest Hemingway, Sherwood Anderson, Jill Johnston, and Lydia Davis",,,,
ENGL 10142,Wordsworth's Poetry. 100 Units.,"In this course we will survey the works of the poet William Wordsworth. We will read widely from his body of verse, paying close attention to questions of style, genre, and form. Throughout his poems and essays, Wordsworth addressed many questions that still matter to us today. What role might poetry play in modern life? How might we understand the relationship between the human imagination and the natural world? Can poetry help us make sense of history? We will consider these questions alongside Wordsworth's poetic explorations of childhood, memory, autobiography, and political revolution. Select secondary criticism will help us understand Wordsworth's cultural and historical context. (Poetry, 1650-1830)",Winter,FNDL 20435,,Will Thompson
ENGL 10144,Jane Austen and Literary Style. 100 Units.,"Jane Austen was a master stylist. This is one of many reasons why her novels have had such a lasting cultural impact. But what specifically are we talking about when we refer to Austen's ""style""? This course attempts to answer this question by exploring the development of Austen's style across three of her major novels: the early Northanger Abbey (1803), the middle-period Sense and Sensibility (1811), and the late Persuasion (1818). Throughout, we will learn to describe, analyze, and interpret one of her trademark formal techniques, free indirect discourse. We will also address the question of literary style alongside a host of related topics: narration, characterization, focalization, and voice. Select secondary readings may include works by narratologists, philosophers, and literary critics. (Fiction, 1650-1830)",Spring,,,Will Thompson
ENGL 10402,Reading the Rom-Com: Renaissance and Modern. 100 Units.,"This course challenges the common assumption that modern romantic comedies are not worthy of academic study by examining early modern iterations of the genre--from William Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew (1590) to Aphra Behn's The Rover (1677). In turning to these sixteenth- and seventeenth-century texts, we will consider how this often trivialized genre encodes, theorizes, and problematizes issues of gender, sex, class, race, and desire through its familiar formula of ""simply"" getting some people to fall in love. (Drama, Pre-1650)",Autumn,GNSE 12135,,Sarah-Gray Lesley
ENGL 10404,Introduction to Poetry. 100 Units.,"This course is an introduction to poetry by way of attention to poetry's arts of condensation, its techniques for producing complexities of meaning in small spaces. While our readings are drawn from a wide historical range, they do not aim to provide a representative survey of English-language poetry. Rather, they serve as a series of explorations of the ways poetic signification works. We will practice slowing down our attention, noticing where things get dense or strange, engaging with the play of poetic language and form, and articulating the questions provoked by that engagement. Our aim is to become better at thinking through poetry: that is, both thinking through the questions we articulate as we grapple with poetic language and form, and thinking about the topics poetry grapples with by way of its peculiar modes of encounter with those problems. To give some focus to our explorations, we will turn throughout the course to questions of gender, sexuality, race, and class, and ask how poetry functions as a distinctive medium for exploring the intersections of subjectivity, desire, power, and social form.

ENGL 10405,"Fantastical London: Literature, Film, Psychogeography. 100 Units.","In a series of classic essays, Walter Benjamin describes Paris as the dreamworld of modernity, crowning it the ""capital of the nineteenth century."" This course follows Benjamin's critique of the modern city as a ""phantasmagoria,"" but shifts the terrain of his argument to ask: what if London were seen as the center of a distinctly dreamlike modernity? What purchase do literature and art afford in the elaboration of this thought-experiment? In this class we will approach London as a city of utopian wishes and Gothic nightmares, exploring the real social conditions and mapping the built environments that mark the Big Smoke as an enduring site of collective fantasy. We will read writings by British authors like Charles Dickens, J.G. Ballard, Iain Sinclair, and China Miéville, alongside works of popular and avant-garde film, comics, and critical theory, to accompany our sojourn through the dream-geography of a fantastical London. This course may also involve site-specific field visits to archetypal London locations and an experimental research/ psychogeography final project.

ENGL 10406,"Eating in Early Modern England: Gender, Race, Food. 100 Units.","The relationship between the construct of idealized femininity and food consumption has a long and troubled history; this course looks at this relationship through premodern Anglophone Literature. From Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales to Mary Rowlandson's The Sovereignty and Goodness of God, this course situates discourses about ""proper"" gender performance and ""proper"" eating habits alongside those of race, religion, sexuality, commodity trade, and colonization to reveal the messy and complicated sociopolitical history of the dinner table.(Fiction, Pre-1650)",Spring,GNSE 12136,,Sarah-Gray Lesley
ENGL 10408,Black American Fiction: Satire and Critique. 100 Units.,"This course explores the power of satire in works of fiction written by black Americans. As we read novels and essays written under the racist regime of Jim Crow and in its aftermath, we will approach satire as a flexible expressive practice that shapes critical judgment into an artistic form. Foundational to the form of the novel, satire is one of the oldest means by which literature has tried to intervene in the world. By examining the genre of satire in general and as African American writers have used it to interrogate the relationship between racism, capitalism, and cultural production in the U.S., we will examine how narrative fiction can critique the category of race and attempt to effect social change. With an attention to the political economy of racism in the US and the role of literature in anti-racist struggle, we will integrate readings in literary criticism, critical theory, and social history to inform our study of fictional works. Fictional works include George Schuyler's Black No More (1931), an incisive work of science fiction and the first great African-American satirical novel; Ishmael Reed's ""NeoHooDoo"" novel Mumbo Jumbo (1972); and Percival Everett's experimental novel Erasure (2001) along with its recent film adaptation, American Fiction (2023). Critical writers may include M.M. Bakhtin, W.E.B. Du Bois, Ralph Ellison, Barbara Fields, Zora Neale Hurston, David Levering Lewis, Adolph Reed, Judith Stein, and Kenneth Warren.

ENGL 10410,Renaissance Insomniacs. 100 Units.,"The world is divided into those who can sleep and those who can't,"" writes French author Marie Darrieussecq in her 2023 memoir on insomnia, Sleepless. Darrieussecq exemplifies, here, a pithy grandiosity commonly born out of the debilitating state of insomnia. In this course, we will explore the broader history of literary insomnia by focusing on early modern English articulations of sleeplessness alongside their political and intellectual contexts-for instance, classical theorizations of insomnium (sometimes glossed as ""nightmare""), melancholy, and the cultural politics of ""biphasic sleep."" Students will also be encouraged to think alongside contemporary research and depictions of insomnia, especially as the condition becomes increasingly concerning in our increasingly sleep-deprived world. What might historical and literary study offer ongoing investigations of sleeplessness? From the bewitching ""incubus"" in Robert Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy, to Macbeth's dramatization of ""murder'd sleep,"" to the poetic descriptions of ""slumb'rous weight"" and hellish restlessness in Milton's Paradise Lost, this course seeks to uncover insights yielded by various efforts to render in writing this uniquely oppressive state of restlessness.

ENGL 10412,"Climate Fiction, Modernism, and the Future. 100 Units.","This course explores novels about climate change alongside works of critical theory about aesthetic modernism, capitalism, and science fiction. We will investigate how climate fiction can critique capitalist modernity by imagining the ecological dimensions of its development and/or collapse. In particular, we will attend to how this literary genre can both exemplify and challenge the contentious modernist imperative to ""make it new."" Thus, at the same time as we study the ways in which climate fiction can render the consequences of climate change intelligible-telling stories that range from the despairing to the hopeful, the surreal to the realistic-we will also debate modernism's aesthetic, historical, and political specificity as an artistic movement. Readings in fiction may include Virginia Woolf, Kim Stanley Robinson, H.G. Wells, Jeff VanderMeer, E.M. Forster, Ben Lerner, and Jessie Greengrass. Readings in critical theory may include Karl Marx, Marshall Berman, Perry Anderson, Fredric Jameson, Darko Suvin, Dipesh Chakrabarty, and Amitav Ghosh.(Fiction, Poetry, 1830-1990, Theory)",Winter,CEGU 20412,,Christopher Gortmaker
ENGL 10414,Documentary/Fantasy in 20th Century American Literature. 100 Units.,"The 20th century was rocked by a series of historical events that challenged the public to face the unimaginable: whether that meant finding language to absorb the violence of the Holocaust or articulate a connection to a history of enslavement, conceptualizing the potential for mutually-ensured destruction created by the atomic bomb or imagining environmental catastrophe. For some writers, the unimaginable has demanded that artists and writers find starkly unadorned ways of documenting it; ways of showing the public that what has happened is in fact real. At other times, the reality of the unimaginable could only be captured by the imaginary: American writers invented forms of writing the real that were absurdist, surreal, increasingly turning to innovations in genre fiction. How did these writers shape or reshape a sense of history as it was happening? What styles of writing are closest to the real? How does the fantastical grapple with history and testimony? The syllabus will pair texts that take documentary approaches to the major events of the century with those that use unreal and surreal ones. Possible pairings include John Hersey's ""Hiroshima"" with Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, Chester Himes' A Rage in Harlem and WEB DuBois' The Souls of Black Folk, Truman Capote's In Cold Blood with Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio, Vladimir Nabokov's Pale Fire with Robert Lowell's Life Studies, Octavia Butler's Kindred with Angela Y.

ENGL 10416,Radical Style: Politics and Writing in the 1960s and 1970s. 100 Units.,"From the iconic militant images of the Black Panthers sporting afros and slinging rifles to the street theater of the Yippies, the melodrama of bra-burning, and the parodic extremity of Valerie Solanas' SCUM manifesto, the moment of the 1960s and 1970s is as synonymous with certain kinds of style as it is with radical politics. Often, the former to the detriment of the latter: the more style, the less substance: for example, the counterculture's tuning in and dropping out depoliticized the student movement and the Black Panthers' star power is ""radical chic"" that undermined the seriousness of their willingness to use revolutionary violence. Why did political activists write and perform their politics this way? What made these politics radical - that is, what is it about them that rethought something from its roots or foundations? Does radical style always suggest a radical politics? This class mixes cultural history, political theory, and literary approaches to the moment of the new social movements of the 1960s. We'll read the serious political texts that invented modern ideas of race, sex, gender, and class politics as having style of their own, and we'll read them alongside the film, poetry, theater (street and otherwise) that made characterized the 60's. We'll also make good use of archives in Chicago, which was one of the primary centers for New Left political activity, and students will have a chance to do firsthand archival research.

ENGL 10420,Ecological Performance. 100 Units.,"We are scavengers,"" reports the anonymous narrator of a 1990 manuscript written by theater maker Rachel Rosenthal. ""The land doesn't nourish us because the deserts are everywhere."" Environmental dread has loomed large over the past few decades, and practitioners working in a range of media have increasingly foregrounded the ecological as a primary aesthetic concern. This course will investigate how recent performances have sought to understand, address, and redress climate catastrophe. We will look to a range of material-possibly including work by Rosenthal, performance collective The Sacred Naked Nature Girls, playwrights Marie Clements and Yvette Nolan, choreographers Jerome Bel, Radouan Mriziga, and Lara Kramer, artists Rebecca Belmore and Olafur Elliason, and many others-in order to examine what tactics performance offers for reckoning with environmental collapse.

ENGL 10428,Medieval Desire. 100 Units.,"In medieval literature, various modes of desire intersect in surprising ways: spiritual devotion unfolds through sensual longing, and personal pleasure intertwines with sacrificial love, producing structures of desire that are conflicting, disorienting, and not so dissimilar from our own. In this course, we will survey a range of late medieval genres to unpack the richly imaginative and experimental discourses of desire housed in fourteenth- and fifteenth-century England. Readings will include dream-vision poems like Pearl, where we will consider the overlaying of economic, domestic, and apocalyptic fantasies; to the hagiographical Book of Margery Kempe, where we will think through the entanglement of gender, embodied spirituality, and erotic encounter. We will interrogate how medieval texts trouble modernity's construction of ""sacred"" and ""secular"" desire as constitutive opposites, coming up with our own terms to better describe the interplay between these categories. How do medieval texts blend seemingly different modes of desire-holy and profane, specific and ambiguous, linear and asynchronic-to construct, obscure, and defamiliarize their objects of desire? What claims to selfhood, language, and knowledge are made by these hybrid models of desire and the multiple meanings they allow? Familiarity with medieval literature or Middle English is neither required nor expected. (Poetry, Pre-1650)",Winter,"GNSE 10428, MDVL 10428",,Kashaf Qureshi
ENGL 10430,Experimental British Poetics 1960-Now. 100 Units.,"This class offers a survey of the Late-Modernist British poetry movement The British Poetry Revival and its afterlives. After WWII, in resistance to a perceived stagnancy in British verse, and inspired by many of the young U.S. poets collected in Donald Allen's New American Poetry anthology (1960), young British poets collected around England and renewed British Modernism. Initially clustered around London, Cambridge, and some Northumbrian cities, the movement (dubbed ""The British Poetry Revival"") has since grown to include the most innovative and vital poetic work written throughout the British Isles. Dense, loud, bombastic, aggressive: this vast corpus of work will offer students a view into recent British culture, economy, and politics, its world after the putative terminal decline of the empire, and its claimed ""special relationship"" with the United States. Its poets are now not just British, include among their number more women and queers, and are dispersed throughout the British Isles. This course will offer a survey of this movement from the 1960s to the present; reading will include its writing: from poetry to performance, correspondence to hallucinatory prose. Students will be asked to consider that poetry does not always look or feel the way we want it to, or the way we think it should. (Poetry, 1830-1990)",Spring,,,James Cole

ENGL 10468,The Art of Criticism. 100 Units.,"What does it mean to be a critic? And how do you write good criticism? In this class, we will study and practice criticism as an art-a medium of creative writing designed to provoke thought, offer ways of viewing the world, and leave readers entertained. Alongside pieces of criticism from various fields-literature, music, film-we'll read reflections and manifestoes on the purpose of criticism, and reflect ourselves on the landscape of criticism today. Where in our own time is criticism practiced? Strung between rapidly changing media and academic worlds, criticism is widely seen as being endangered, and yet, with the past decade's resurgence of small, lively intellectual and cultural magazines, others have claimed that we live in a golden age of criticism. We will try to make sense of this, while meanwhile taking ourselves seriously as critics: sharing with each other the work of critics we admire and writing our own critical essays.

If fiction is't true, what kind of knowledge or understanding can it offer? From the printing press to generative AI, how do fiction and technology interract? Focusing on the short story and the novel, we'll consider fictions and theories of fiction from authors including George Eliot, Henry James, Virginia Woolf, and Toni Morrison.

ENGL 12125,"Living Queer: Experiences, Encounter, Affinities. 100 Units.","In this interdisciplinary seminar, we will explore representations and expressions of queer and trans lives across the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Assembling a diverse archive of artistic works and cultural artifacts (fiction, memoir, film, lyric poetry, anthology, activist ephemera) together with foundational works in the study of sexuality and gender, we will ask: How do hegemonic institutions, discourses, and definitions - from medical models of pathology to hostile bureaucratic infrastructure - shape the expressive forms available to queer and trans people? And how does the literary, artistic, and activist work of queer and trans people work in turn to reshape those very expressive possibilities? How can individual experiences of isolation and marginalization form the basis of a community or subculture? How are erotic creativity, imaginative life, and political action linked? Our readings will introduce a range of critical and creative methods - such as oral history, ethnography, autobiography, performance - that scholars and artists have used to theorize and represent queer life. Through short ""micro-assignments,"" we will try out these methods for ourselves. By interweaving the creative work of queer and trans people and communities with practical experiments in research and making, we will aim to broaden our collective understanding of what it might mean to ""live queer.""

ENGL 12704,Writing Persuasion: Health and Environment. 100 Units.,"A writing-intensive course in persuasive techniques that influence opinions and attempt to change behavior. This year our focus will be on an issue that presents a challenge for persuasion theory: the environment. People are notoriously slow to change their beliefs and behavior on environmental issues, and persuasion theory suggests reasons why this might be the case. Environmental problems ask readers to weigh costs that affect one group against benefits that might accrue to someone else. They involve time frames ranging from moments (which are easy to think and write about) to millennia (not so easy) to geological epochs, a time scale so remote from our experience as to be opaque to the imagination. Environmental problems are complex in ways that make them difficult to capture in a coherent, emotionally compelling narrative. Many individually innocuous and seemingly unrelated environmental events can converge over time to produce consequences that are counter-intuitively larger and graver than their causes. This felt disparity between actions and outcomes can violate an audience's sense of fairness, biasing the audience against a persuasive appeal.",Spring,"CEGU 22704, ENGL 32704, ENST 12704",,Tracy Weiner

On the one hand, we will pay attention to the scientific, political, and cultural contexts from which particular visions of the future emerged; on the other, we will work to develop an overarching sense of science fiction as a genre. We will deploy different analytical paradigms (Formalist, Marxist, Feminist, &c.) to apprehend the stakes and the strategies for imagining future worlds. After some initial attention to the magazine and pulp culture that helped to establish the genre, we will spotlight major SF movements (Afro Futurism, Cyberpunk, Biopunk, etc.) and major authors (including Robert Heinlein, Philip K. Dick, Ursula K. Le Guin, Samuel R. Delaney, William Gibson, and Octavia Butler).

What is politically and ideologically productive in employing ""Asian American"" as a pan-ethnic signifier? What are its shortcomings? And how do the parameters of this term alter in accordance with its specific historical and social contingencies? How do artists within different mediums negotiate their identity/identities through their chosen aesthetic form? To offer a fuller portrait of the capaciousness of how Asian American artists attend to their self-representation, this course brings together texts that are familiar to a broader public as well as those that linger on the fringe of institutional canonization, ranging from H.

If they seem historically distant, both texts nonetheless show disabled characters in complex relation to their communities. This course looks at contemporary texts alongside Middle English ones to ask how medieval English literature can illuminate our present understanding of disability in media. While Middle English literature lacks our term disability, it is populated with figures whose bodies and minds are depicted as deviating from the norm. Through pairings of medieval and contemporary texts, as well as disability theory readings, we will examine how stories now and then 1) moralize bodily difference, 2) figure disabled bodies of intersecting identities, and 3) attempt to express in words exclusion from and participation in communal life. Questions we will ask: How do the portrayals of disabled characters reveal a society's definition of the normal (what disability studies terms the ""normate"")? Which stereotypes do literary texts perpetuate about disability, and can we produce readings that counter these harmful portrayals? Can barriers to access lead to creativity and imagination? Finally: what role do literary histories play in helping us understand medieval and contemporary conceptions of disability?

What is it about Melville's corpus that has made it amenable to so many different kinds of conversations, and what about it sparks particular interest during our present moment? Students in this class will have a chance to think across the disciplines with Melville by reading some of his most important work-from the exhilarating, epic ride that is Moby-Dick to shorter pieces from Benito Cereno, a tale of mysterious events aboard a slave ship, to ""Bartleby, the Scrivener: A Story of Wall-Street.""

Plays to be studied include The Comedy of Errors, The Taming of the Shrew, The Merchant of Venice, Measure for Measure, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Twelfth Night, Richard III, Richard II, and Henry V. Together, we will read some of Shakespeare's queerest and most delightful comedies in conversation with darker troubling plays that revolve around sexual violence, racism, nationalism, and political theory, and we will see how such topics put generic boundaries to the test. Valuing those classics for their timeless craft but also for the situated cultural horizon that they evidence, we will explore what it means to take comedy and history seriously.

ENGL 17920,The Slaves' Narratives. 100 Units.,"As rare first-person accounts of an institution that claimed the lives of millions, slave narratives occupy an important, almost sacred position in the history of American letters. In part, this course will offer a literary history of this genre of writing. We will consider the relationship of the slave narrative to other available genres of life writing: spiritual autobiography, captivity narratives, gallows narratives, and so on. We will consider a host of political problems that the slave narrative raises, such as: What levels of autonomy or agency could black writers hope to achieve in relation to white editors, sponsors, and abolitionist organizations? What is the evidentiary value of these narratives? How do the generic conventions of the slave narrative conscript black subjects into just giving ""the facts"" to white ""philosophers,"" as Frederick Douglass would critique, instead of enabling black subjects to theorize slavery and freedom in their own names? At the same time, we will explore print media not typically considered under the rubric of the ""slave narrative"" to thicken our understanding of black life-making in the shadow of slavery: legal petitions, court testimony, letters, and early novels.

ENGL 18108,Culture and the Police. 100 Units.,"How do cultural products facilitate, abet, and enable the form of social ordering that we call policing? This course will explore the policing function of what modernity calls ""culture"" by exploring the parallel histories of policing, the emergence of modern police theory, and the rise of the novel. We will focus in particular on how both literature and the police emerge to navigate a series of linked epistemological and political problematics: the relation between particularity and abstraction, the relation between deviance and normalcy, and indeed that of authority as such. While we will focus on texts from the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Atlantic world, students with a broader interest in policing are encouraged to enroll. Readings will include Aphra Behn, Daniel Defoe, Henry Fielding, G.W.F. Hegel, Louis Althusser, and Michel Foucault, in addition to historical documents including gallows narratives, newspapers, and early theorizations of the police concept.

Some priority will be given to films with London settings and locations, such as Frears's My Beautiful Launderette. We may also look at London-based films by non-British directors. Sylvio Narrizaon's George Girl, for example, or Antonioni's Blow-up.

In this discussion-heavy course we will watch a lot of film from the directorial subjects of his main discussions (Chaplin, Rossellini, Lynch, Haneke, Kieślowski, Tarkovsky, von Trier, Hitchcock, and others) alongside Zizek's theoretical writings on their film. The course examines why for the man who has been called the ""Elvis of cultural theory"" film is such a perfect lens through which to examine social situatedness and intersubjective ""aporia.""

Taking the lead from Bachelard this course investigates the construction, beginning in the eighteenth century, of childhood as a particular kind of place, one that might be imaginatively accessed through poetic images, rhythm, and rhyme. Our readings will come from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries-that is, from the birth of children's literature to its ""golden age""-and will take us from the nursery rhymes and cradle songs of early children's poetry collections, through William Blake's ""forests of the night,"" and to the wonderland of Lewis Carroll's Alice books.

ENGL 19902,Virginia Woolf and the Bloomsbury Group. 100 Units.,"A controversial art exhibition organized by Roger Fry, ""Manet and the Post-Impressionists,"" provoked Virginia Woolf to write that ""on or about December 1910 human character changed."" The Bloomsbury Group, renowned for its role in vilifying Victorian culture and promoting English modernism, was no less famous for its own efforts to change human character: for its unprecedented understanding of aesthetics, economics, social politics, and sexuality. Taking advantage of our particular location in London (the neighborhood in which the group lived, met, wrote, and painted), this course will provide the opportunity to engage a broad spectrum of Bloomsbury work: the essays and fiction of Virginia Woolf; the art of Venessa Bell, Duncan Grant, and Roger Fry; the macroeconomics of John Maynard Keynes. This engagement will unfold through different analytics (formalist, psychoanalytic, materialist), and with sustained recognition of two Bloomsbury institutions-the short-lived Omega Workshops, and the enduring Hogarth Press. The British Library and the Tate Modern will provide us with intimate access to literary and visual texts, and we will talk with contemporary writers about the cultural legacy of this coterie.

ENGL 19960,Comedy from the Margins. 100 Units.,"This course examines the centrality of normativity to our conceptions of funniness, reading theories of comedy alongside stand-up, sitcoms, dramedy, and romantic comedy. We will ask: in what ways do comedic formulas establish ideas of the ""normal"" in order to subvert (or perhaps reinforce) them? How, does comedy about the ""strange""-as the foreign, the queer, the excessive or the abject-reframe structures of sociality often taken for granted, forcing us to grapple with questions of citizenship and belonging, gendered and sexual norms, racialization and power? In addition to theories of comedy and joke theory, students will analyze theoretical works on race, gender and sexuality alongside popular television series, talk shows, and comedy specials. Possible texts and comics include: Chewing Gum, Fleabag, Insecure, Reservation Dogs, Ramy, Atlanta, Awkwafina is Nora from Queens, Julio Torres, Hasan Minhaj, Ali Wong, Jacqueline Novak, Dave Chappelle, Hannah Gadsby, and Ronny Chieng.

We will study the historical development of the English language, from its Proto-Indo-European roots through its earliest recorded forms (Old English, Middle English, and Early Modern English) up to its current status as a world language. Now spoken by more than 1.5 billion people, English is a language that is constantly evolving, and students will gain basic linguistic skills necessary for analyzing the features of its evolution. We will study variations in the language (including variations in morphology, phonology, syntax, grammar, and vocabulary) and its development over time and across regions.

And how are these varied forms of living reflected in the vast body of texts by writers and film makers who have made London their home? National capital and imperial metropolis, London is also a network of local neighborhoods in which communities have developed over time. In this course we will examine texts by an assortment of Londoners from the 19th and 20th centuries who write about urban sites of human interaction and encounter. Our course will consider London locations as places of compassion, repression, brutality, hospitality and rejection, resistance and compliance, friendship and love. How are these possibilities - both affective and political, personal and public - related to the various environments of the city? How are human relationships shaped by the specific forms of city buildings and institutions? And how have these urban places been impacted by styles of city living, changing populations, and the different communities that have inhabited them? In short, how do Londoners live together?

During the first two weeks of the course, our reading will center on eighteenth-century writing. Primarily, we will focus on the work of prominent Black writers in London in and around abolition, including the life narratives of the formerly enslaved Olaudah Equiano (1789), Ottobah Cugoano (1787), and Mary Prince (1831), the published letters of Ignatius Sancho (1780), and the poetry of Phillis Wheatley Peters (1773). We may also read selections from white-authored abolitionist poetry, relevant legal cases, as well as the anonymously published novel, The Woman of Colour (1808). In our third week, we will tum to a number of recent works that look back to the eighteenth century in order to reimagine the past and present of Black life in British culture, or to reclaim ·a place in the national imaginary: Honoree Fanonne Jeffers' The Age of Phillis, M. NourbeSe Philip's Zangl, and perhaps a play or two 0asmine Lee-Jones' Curious, Jackie Sibblies Drury's Marys S eacole, Giles Terera's The Meaning of Zon!).

ENGL 20170,Experiments in Kinship and Care. 100 Units.,"In this class, we'll examine the notions of kinship and care, analyzing them both as conceptual frameworks and as concrete forms of being-together in human and more-than-human relations. Kinship and care are uncertain territories, fluctuating and dynamic; sites of possibility and futurity. Kin-making and care-giving practices reveal existing structures of oppression as well as the utopian possibilities within relation. We'll spend much of our time engaging with a set of ""experiments"" or case studies-historical, science fictional, and critical accounts of community-to see how connection appears as a mode of resistance or survival. Throughout, our collective goal will be to think together about living together. Readings may include SF from Octavia Butler, Claire Coleman, Ursula Le Guin, Wu Ming-Yi; theoretical and critical work from Sara Ahmed, Leela Gandhi, Donna Haraway, Laura Harjo, Saidiya Hartman, Kara Keeling, Audre Lorde, José Esteban Muñoz, Maria Puig de la Bellacasa, Dean Spade, Kim Tallbear, Anna Tsing.",Winter,"GNSE 41170, GNSE 21170, MAPH 40170, ENGL 40170",,William Hutchison
ENGL 20171,"Robots, animals, technologies: Science fiction and the more-than-human. 100 Units.","Science fiction allows encounters with other beings that variously encourage or strain the bonds of kinship, and many of those beings are related to entities with whom we already share a world. From companion animals and modified humans to starfish and androids, estrangement from familiar categories allows us to trouble assumptions about the certainty of species, the superiority of consciousness, and what care looks like in relation with those who may not respond to, recognize, or return care in familiar ways. In this class, we'll look at relations with the more-than-human in the context of urgent and emergent lived experience, in which social, political, and environmental realities require a response that thinks beyond entrenched approaches and takes wild and revolutionary imagination as a reparative possibility. We'll explore these and other questions through science fiction novels, poetry, graphic novels, music, and video (by Octavia Butler, Ursula Le Guin, Vonda McIntyre, Janelle Monae, Grant Morrison, Margaret Rhee, and others). We'll engage with theoretical work on topics including multispecies kinship, race and technology, and non-conscious/non-biological life (by Karen Barad, Beth Coleman, Wendy Chun, Donna Haraway, N.

Drawing on the work of critics such as Luce Irigaray, Caroline Walker Bynum, and Judith Butler, we explore what strategies these writers employ to depict an entity simultaneously understood to be unrepresentable and to have a masculine image. Texts range from premodern mystics such as Julian of Norwich and Teresa of Avila to Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower.

ENGL 20190,The Gender of Modernity. 100 Units.,"This course examines the dramatic revisions in gender and sexuality that characterize American modernity. Together, we will read literary texts by women and queer writers to investigate their role in shaping the period's emergent regimes of sex and gender. We'll consider modernist revisions of these concepts for their effect on America's broader social and political terrain and explore the intimate histories they made possible: What new horizons for kinship, care, affect, and the everyday reproduction of life did modernist ideas about sex and gender enable? This class doubles as an advanced introduction to gender and sexuality studies, with a particular emphasis on literary criticism. As we map the contours of a feminist and queer modernity, we will also be staging a series of encounters between our literary objects and influential theoretical texts. In so doing, we will consider a range of methodological orientations - psychoanalytic, queer, Black feminist, Marxist, postcolonial, historicist, and so on - as themselves telling divergent stories about what it means to be a sexed and gendered body in American modernity. Readings may include works by Djuna Barnes, Gwendolyn Brooks, H.D., Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Henry James, Nella Larsen, Gertrude Stein; theoretical and critical work from Lauren Berlant, Leo Bersani, Judith Butler, Hélène Cixous, Lee Edelman, Rita Felski, Jack Halberstam, Saidiya Hartman, Eve Sedgwick, Hortense Spillers, Gayatri Spivak, Alys Weinbaum.",Winter,"GNSE 25150, ENGL 40190, GNSE 45150, AMER 40190, MAPH 40190",,Agnes Malinowska

We will also address foundational and recent critical-theoretical approaches to the many ""natures"" of Romanticism. Our contextual materials will engage the art of landscape, an influx of exotic and dangerously erotic flora, practices of collection and display, the emergent localism of the naturalist Gilbert White, the emergence of geological ""deep time,"" and the (literal) fruits of empire and vegetarianism.

ENGL 20242,Structural -isms. 100 Units.,"What does it mean to designate ""structure"" as the operative force in discrimination against categories of person-as in appeals to structural racism or structural violence on the basis of gender? And how can we approach this question by attending to aesthetic uses of structure and form, especially as these have been understood in such paradigms as structuralism and recent literary formalisms? How do we read for structure, in reading for racism and for systemic discrimination on other bases? We'll focus on intersections of race, gender, and class (in U.S. contexts) as these categories have been reconfigured in the past half century or so. To explore appeals to structure, we'll consider definitions of literary and aesthetic form, debates about structure vs. agency, and questions of individual and collective action as mediated by institutions. Readings will balance theory with examples drawn from fiction, documentary film, built form, and other media. Throughout, we'll pay particular attention to problems of structure construed as problems of narrative, as we develop sharper terms for understanding how discrimination proceeds structurally.",Spring,"ENGL 40141, GNSE 25141, CRES 40141, MAPH 40141, GNSE 45141, CRES 22141",,Rowan Bayne

How does a manuscript of poetry 'make it' onto the list of a literary publisher, and from there to the bookshelves of the Seminary Coop? How do individual readers and editorial collectives imagine the work of literary assessment and aesthetic judgment in our time? We will begin the course with a survey of new directions in Anglophone poetry as preparation for an intensive editorial practicum in the evaluation and assessment of literary manuscripts in the second half of the term.

ENGL 20260,Housekeeping: Domestic Drama and Material Culture. 100 Units.,"The theatre represents a new and wildly successful commodity in the early modern English market. Yet it is often kept separate from other fashionable goods of the period by virtue of its intangible form. This course overturns the orthodoxy that an early modern play was a co-imaged event and the early modern theatre was an ""empty space"" by attending to the Renaissance theatre's frequent recourse to household stuff. We will read plays designed for private performance, that use the fixtures of the household to build theatrical worlds. We will investigate dramatists who liken the playhouse to key venues of commodity culture, including the pawnshop, the Exchange (the precedent of the shopping mall), and the fairground. We will draw from Henslowe's Diary to recover the business of theatrical property-making and the allure of a company as disclosed by its holdings. All the while, we will question how the fiction of emptiness takes hold in theatre history, and how plays that depict a furnished world are relegated to second-class genres like domestic tragedy and city comedy.

Why were innocents punished and exploiters vindicated? Why is justice out of reach, compassion rare, and even communication difficult? And, given these disappointments, why have readers and writers around the world been obsessed with Crime and Punishment since its publication over 150 years ago? Dostoevsky's novels ""claw their way into us"" (Iser), ""we are drawn in, whirled around, suffocated…"" (Woolf). Although he was ""a messenger"" to James Baldwin, ""more human, better than human"" in Akira Kurosawa's estimation, and ""the only psychologist"" worth learning from according to Friedrich Nietzsche, the real-life Dostoevsky was a desperate gambler, cheater, and chauvinist, not unlike some of the worst characters in his novels. He was recently heralded as both an example of Russian humanism (by Pope Francis) and the ""father of Russian fascism"" (by a Russian intellectual). Reading Crime and Punishment, we will endeavor to make sense of Dostoevsky's--and the novel's--failures and triumphs.

ENGL 20422,Black Girlhood. 100 Units.,"First popularized on social media in 2013, the phrase ""Black Girl Magic"" has expanded far beyond its initial use as a twitter hashtag. It can be seen on (a bunch of different objects and the cover of many children's books and poetry anthologies). However, the visibility of the phrase did not come without controversy. Some critics argued that rather than being an uplifting rallying cry for positive depictions of black girlhood, it instead reinforced dehumanizing stereotypes of the ""strong black woman"". This debate leads us to question: How do black girls tend to be depicted both popular media and in literature? How might these depictions differ depending on author, type of media, or social context? What do they say about the ways that black girls experience childhood, gender, and friendship? To engage with these questions, this course will explore literary works including The Bluest Eye, Betsey Brown, and Abeng, along with television shows such as Lovecraft Country to examine 20th and 21st century depictions of black girlhood.

In this course, we take up the inscrutability of others through a range of narratives about - politically, socially, and geographically - distant others from the early 20th century. Texts include fiction, documentary film, and critical theory around transnationalism, contact zones and ethnography). Some of these texts meditate on the general problem of living with others. Others take on the limits of empathy, access, and friendship whether explicitly or in their formal arrangement. Specifically, we focus on works that engage with an ethics or ""work on the self"" as a preliminary to having knowledge of others. We will be guided by primary readings that likely include Claude Levi-Strauss, Kazuo Ishiguro, Werner Herzog, Maggie Nelson, Amitav Ghosh, and J.M. Coetzee.

In this course, we read and think through the literary and conceptual resources that might help us reconstruct this notion - from Deepika Bahri, to Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin. Our goal is to attend to ""the aesthetic"" as an experience that reshapes subjectivity in terms of our relation to ourselves and others. By engaging with twentieth-century novels, memoir, and film, we consider how this postcolonial aesthetic might function. What habituated forms of perception or common sense notions does it seek to interrupt? What ways of sensing and living does it offer?

We will think across discipline about the methodologies that make dramaturgy a heuristic knowledge practice. We will think critically about existing genealogies, best practices, and innovations in the theatre industry. Most importantly, we will engage in our own civic-minded dramaturgical practice and how engaged, thoughtful storytelling might have impacts beyond the walls of the classroom and the theatre.

ENGL 20720,Film and Fiction. 100 Units.,"This course addresses three distinct but related critical problems in the contemporary understanding of film and fiction. The most general is the question of how we might go about linking the practice of criticism in the literary arts with that of the screen arts. Where are the common issues of structure, form, narration, point of view management, and the like? Where, on the other hand, are the crucial differences that lie in the particularities of each domain-the problem that some have labeled ""medium specificity"" in the arts? The second problem has to do more specifically with questions of adaptation. Adaptation is a fact of our cultural experience that we encounter in many circumstances, but perhaps in non more insistently as when we witness the reproduction of a literary narrative in cinematic or televisual form? Adaptation theory has taught us to look beyond the narrow criterion of ""fidelity"" a far too limiting in scope? But when we look beyond, what do we look for, and what other concepts guide our exploration? The third and final problem has to do with the now rampant genre of the ""film based on fact,"" especially when the facts derive from a particular source text, as in the recent case of Spike Lee's BlacKkKlansman? What has this genre become so popular? What are its particular genre markings (e.g., excessive stylization, the use of documentary footage of the actual persons and events involved)? How does fictionalization operate on the facts in particular cases?",Spring,CMST 25820,Students enrolled in the course will be expected to attend screenings and participate in class discussions.

Students in this course will assist in the dramaturgical preparations for the Spring 2019 premiere of Auburn's work, and in so doing acquire hands-on experience of the techniques involved in bringing literary works to stage. They will engage in close readings of the novel and its relationship to drafts of the script, examine how Bellow drew from his own coming-of-age experiences as an immigrant in Depression-era Chicago to create the character of Augie March, and seek out primary source materials at libraries and museums throughout the city to help contextualize the work for the director, actors, costume and sound designers.

ENGL 21210,The Enterprise of Middlemarch. 100 Units.,"Students will begin by taking up the Norton edition and reading the novel through; discussion will then proceed by re-reading (along with some other materials from that edition) taking up carious topics, e.g Eliot's self-presentation of her authorial aims, some important fictional choices (e.g: why a provincial town? why set the novel in 1832? etc.). Then we will consider the complex set of plots and their relation to each other. Other questions: how does the book represent itself as a model for the novel as a genre?

Nevertheless, there is (in my mind at least) no question that we have Hamlet! I intend with this class to explore the play in quest (as it were) of the essential Hamlet, reflecting on its contradictions, shifting perspectives, puzzles. For instance: why doesn't Hamlet go back to Wittenburg-is it his ambition, his mother, his sense that he has to deal with his uncle, or is it something else? Is Hamlet mad or feigning or something in between? Is he changed by his adventure with the pirates? Etc. We will use both volumes of the Arden 3rd edition. First, we'll spend some weeks going through the Folio text scene by scene, then we'll tackle the 1st Quarto, inquiring into Shakespeare's creative process and his relation to actual production. Some attention will be given also to the history of the reception of Hamlet.

Beginning with Morrison's 1993 Nobel Prize Lecture, this class will read (for many reread) two of Toni Morrison's novels that pose the house and household as a ""site of memory"" in which to dramatize gendered histories of race in North America. Our class will annotate together Beloved and A Mercy with the essays, films, poetry of various scholars, in addition to some of Morrison's literary critical and historical writings. Our in-depth reading of these two works will provide a foundation for engaging in ongoing debates about race and writing in literary studies, black feminists critiques of the classroom, and histories of race-based slavery in North America. If, as Morrison contends, ""language"" teaches us ""how to see without pictures"" and that ""language alone protects us from the scariness of things with no names,"" we will aim to hold language close as we consider ""what moves at the margin. What it is to have no home in this place. To be set adrift from the one you knew. What it is to live at the edge of towns that cannot bear your company.""

What theories, resources, and models of personal, psychoanalytic, legal, political repair are available, and what kinds of possibilities do they enable? Is repair even a possibility, or a useful framework, for change? This course tracks the question of repair through contemporary conversations and historical case studies. Reading works by Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein, Eve Ensler, Saidiya Hartman, Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò, Eve Tuck and K.

ENGL 21360,"Gender, Capital, and Desire: Jane Austen and Critical Interpretation. 100 Units.","Today, Jane Austen is one of the most famous (perhaps the most famous), most widely read, and most beloved of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century British novelists. In the 200 years since her authorial career, her novels have spawned countless imitations, homages, parodies, films, and miniseries - not to mention a thriving ""Janeite"" fan culture. For just as long, her novels have been the objects of sustained attention by literary critics, theorists, and historians. For example, feminist scholars have long been fascinated by Austen for her treatments of feminine agency, sociality, and desire. Marxists read her novels for the light they shed on an emergent bourgeoisie on the eve of industrialization. And students of the ""rise of the novel"" in English are often drawn to Austen as an innovator of new styles of narration and a visionary as to the potentials of the form. This course will offer an in-depth examination of Austen, her literary corpus, and her cultural reception as well as a graduate-level introduction to several important schools of critical and theoretical methodology. We will read all six of Austen's completed novels in addition to criticism spanning feminism, historicism, Marxism, queer studies, postcolonialism, and psychoanalysis.

ENGL 21370,"Ships, Tyrants, and Mutineers. 100 Units.","Since the Renaissance beginnings of the ""age of sail,"" the ship has been one of literature's most contested, exciting, fraught, and ominous concepts. Ships are, on the one hand, globe-traversing spaces of alterity and possibility that offer freedom from the repression of land-based systems of power. And they are Michel Foucault's example of the heterotopia par excellence. From Lord Byron to Herman Melville to Anita Loos, the ship has been conceived as a site of queerness and one that puts great pressure on normative constructions of gender. At the same time, the ship has been a primary mechanism for the brutality of empire and hegemony of capital, the conduit by which vast wealth has been expropriated from the colony, military domination projected around the world, and millions of people kidnapped and enslaved. Indeed, the horror of the ""Middle Passage"" of the Atlantic slave trade has been a major focus of inquiry for theorists like Paul Gilroy and Hortense Spillers, interrogating how concepts of racial identity and structures of racism emerge out of oceanic violence. In the 20th and 21st centuries, science-fiction writers have sent ships deep into outer space, reimagining human social relations and even humans-as-species navigating the stars. While focusing on the Enlightenment and 19th century, we will examine literary and filmic texts through the present that have centered on the ship, as well as theoretical texts that will help us to deepen our inquiries.

ENGL 21420,Futures Other Than Ours: Science Fiction and Utopia. 100 Units.,"Science fiction is often mistaken for a variety of futurism, extrapolating what lies ahead. This class will consider what kind of relationship science fiction might have to the future other than prediction, anticipation, optimism or pessimism. How might science fiction enable thinking or imaging futures in modes other than those available to liberalism (progress, reproduction, generation) or neoliberalism (speculation, anticipation, investment)? This class asks how science fiction constitutes its horizons, where and how difference emerges in utopias, and what it might be to live in a future that isn't ours.

ENGL 21644,"American Muckrakers: The Literature of Exposé, 1900/2000. 100 Units.","This seminar examines the genre of American ""muckraking,"" a form of journalism and fiction intended to expose social and economic injustices. We attend, in particular, to writers active in the years surrounding 1900, when muckraking narratives enjoyed great social influence, and then turn to the new crop of prominent muckrakers that emerged around 2000. In coining the term ""muck-rake"" in a 1906 speech, President Theodore Roosevelt linked the genre's aesthetic deficiencies to a potentially dangerous political impact: Its tendency towards ""hysteric sensationalism"" threatened to provoke a ""morbid and vicious public sentiment"" marked by cynical apathy. Though we may not end up agreeing with Roosevelt, the seminar picks up his emphasis on the relationship between the aesthetics and politics of exposé in our examination of muckraking media. We will discuss the narrative strategies of a genre often designated as ""bad"" literature, focusing, in particular, on the link between its purported aesthetic deficiencies-populism, sentimentalism, melodrama, sensationalism-and its political mission. Last but certainly not least, this seminar situates muckraking narratives in their historical contexts-what they hoped to expose, why, and what impact they ended up having. Texts in this course may include the work of: Upton Sinclair, Ida Tarbell, Jacob Riis, Ray Stannard Baker, Frank Norris, Lincoln Steffens, Barbara Ehrenreich, Eric Schlosser, Naomi Klein, Michael Moore, and Laurie Garrett.",Spring,"MAPH 41600, ENGL 41644",,Agnes Malinowska
ENGL 21690,Empire and the Novel. 100 Units.,"This course investigates how the rise of the nineteenth-century British novel is intimately linked to the expansion of the British Empire. Many understand that this empire was based on unfair trade relations, indigenous genocide, and the exploitative labor of millions, but it can be difficult at times to see how this atrocious history fits into the domestic and metropolitan realism of the novel. How does the practice of imperialism impact the conventions of domestic fiction? How are the novel's constructions of gender, race, and class related to the political status of colonized and enslaved peoples? Our focus will be to connect narrative form with the realities of imperialism and colonial rule, but we will also draw on other genres of nineteenth-century cultural production such as autobiography, visual art, and political essays in order to help us trace the sociopolitical conditions that made empire possible. Fictional readings may include work by Charlotte Brontë, Wilkie Collins, George Eliot, Olive Schreiner, and others. Non-fictional readings may include work by Aimé Césaire, Franz Fanon, Saidiya Hartman, Karl Marx, Mary Jane Seacole, Edward Said, Gayatri Spivak.

ENGL 21692,Mapping Racial Formations of Citizenship through the Novel. 100 Units.,"How is race central to the concept of citizenship? This course investigates the racial roots of the development of citizenship within nineteenth- and twentieth- century histories of slavery, colonialism, migration, eugenics, and miscegenation, with primary focus on the novel. To be a 'citizen' means to claim political belonging in a particular nation-state, but the status of one's racial identity complicates one's access to the rights and privileges that citizenship presupposes. In this course, we trace how the construction of race is integral to the varied meanings of citizenship's lexicon: individual and collective identities, kinship, self-determination, subjectivity, nationhood. Along the way, we will examine the ways that the novel makes visible radical forms of memory, affect, intergenerational forms of connection, and other practices that exceed racialized definitions of the 'citizen' and civic inclusion. Our focus will be to connect narrative form with the realities of racialized citizenship, but we will also draw on other genres of cultural production such as autobiography, visual art, and political essays in order to help us trace the sociopolitical connections between race and citizenship.",Spring,,,Rebeca Velasquez
ENGL 21701,"Transformative Description: Ethnography, Documentary and Modernist American Literature. 100 Units.","The work of description-the way that writers convey the characteristic features and significant details of people and places in language-can contain and confirm biases and anchor stale tropes of identity, but can also refuse, exceed, play with, and subverting readerly expectations. Descriptions made for the purposes of political consciousness-raising, journalistic documenting, or narrative storytelling bring into sharp relief senses of ourselves in relation to perceptions of ""otherness"" along lines of place, race, class, and gender. In this class, we will read literary and photographic works by authors such as Zora Neale Hurston, Richard Wright, William Faulkner, James Agee and Walker Evans and focus on how they experiment with methodologies of description and representation of people borrowed from anthropology, photography, and documentary journalism, as well as literary techniques like stream-of-consciousness narration and first-personal disclosure-to productively account for the limitations of their individual perspectives and authorial voices as a narrative and poetic tool.

Rock formations, plants, metallic seams, plastics, crystalline structures, nuclear waste and oozing seepages are among the entities that allow SF to form estranging questions about what it means to be in relation to others, what it means to live in and through an environment, and what it means to form relations of sustenance and communal possibility with those who do not or cannot return human care and recognition. Such questions about are urgent ones for thinking about climate catastrophe, capital, settler colonialism and endemic pandemics, as well as for thinking substantively about resistance and what life and livable worlds beyond the bleak horizons of the present could be.

We will engage with these other worlds in an attempt to formulate our own visions of other possible forms of communal life and relation. We will pay particular attention to questions of liberatory struggle; borders, policing and imprisonment; race, gender, family and social reproduction; and environment and ecological relations. We'll also spend some time thinking about actually existing forms of living against the state (including encampments, blockades, autonomous zones).

What it does seek to do, however, is give you some little sense of the Victorian novel's formal and thematic range in a few of the uncharacteristically shorter novels of the period, and-in the bargain-give you a few critical tools and concepts to better figure out what these novels are and what they might be doing. Critical approaches to the Victorian novel are as varied as the novels themselves, perhaps, but I've tried to give you access to some of the more recent interventions that centrally query character and characterization (people), things and the circulation of things, and location and spatialization (places).

ENGL 22360,Working 9 to 5. 100 Units.,"Freedom"" under capital, Marx wrote, contains a fundamental contradiction. The worker is free to sell their labor because they have escaped medieval serfdom - but they are also ""free"" of land, property, tools, or machinery to create their own wealth: ""And this history, the history of their expropriation, is written in the annals of mankind in letters of blood and fire."" Since at least the eighteenth century, British and American literature has explored, and is often structured by, this conflict. On the one hand, the novel tells the story of the sovereign individual, guiding their own fortunes and producing order out of a fantasy ""state of nature."" On the other hand, radical and proletarian writers have deployed the novel - and later, the screen - as a genre of class struggle, critiquing the violence of capital and how that violence intersects with the violences of racism, patriarchy, and imperialism. This course will read widely in literary and filmic representations of work and workers from the co-emergence of the novel and modern capital in the early eighteenth century through the present.

How have the unique precolonial, colonial, regional and national histories of this region shaped the peculiar nature of environmental issues? We will consider three major concepts-""extinction"", ""disaster"" and ""dystopia"" to see how they can be used to frame issues of environmental and ecological concern. Each concept will act as a framing device for issues such as conservation and preservation of wildlife, erasure of adivasi (first dwellers) ways of life, environmental justice, water scarcity and climate change. The course will aim to develop students' ability to assess the specificity of these concepts in different disciplines. For example: What methods and sources will an environmental historian use to write about wildlife? How does this differ from the approach an ecologist or literary writer might take?

In The Arts of Life (1802), John Aikin surveys the means of provision of food, clothing, and shelter in the Romantic age by means of a watchword distinction between those arts either ""absolutely necessary for life's preservation"" or ""conducive to comfort and convenience,"" as against those ""ministering to luxury and pleasure."" The same idea memorably animates the aesthetic counter-tradition running from William Blake's ""arts of life and death"" to William Morris's ""lesser arts of life. In contextualizing the problem of the ""arts of life,"" we will resurrect productive historical thinking about an aesthetics that inextricably inheres within practices ""necessary for the preservation of life."" We will also explore the enduring vitality of such a notion in our own moment of ecological crisis and of casualized cultural arts (ostensibly marked by eclipsed autonomy for art's producers, consumers, and critics alike), with particular focus on problems of design and the affordances of form; on literature's evolving location among the ""arts of life""; and on the present reinvigoration of craft and design in popular visions of the aesthetic.

ENGL 22680,Queering the American Family Drama. 100 Units.,"This course will examine what happens to the American Family Drama on stage when the 'family' is queer. Working in dialogue with a current production at Court Theatre, we will move beyond describing surface representations into an exploration of how queering the family implicates narrative, plot, character, formal conventions, aesthetics and production conditions (e.g. casting, venues, audiences, marketing and critical reception). Texts will include theatrical plays and musicals, recorded and live productions, and queer performance theory. This course will be a combined seminar and studio, inviting students to investigate through readings, discussion, staging experiments, and a choice of either a final paper or artistic project.",Autumn,"AMER 22680, GNSE 20116, TAPS 22680, SIGN 26080",,L.

ENGL 22930,Intro to Critical Race Theory. 100 Units.,"Critical Race Theory (CRT) has recently filled headlines as it has become a hotly debated topic in U.S. political, educational, and media discourse. However, the tenets and thinkers that shape CRT tend to be left out of the conversations that dominate the media. What is this theoretical framework? Who are the thinkers who shape and contribute to these theories of the construction of race? What does CRT say about the relationship between race and institutions, such as the United States' legal system or education? To address these questions, students in this course will read and engage with foundational texts of CRT by scholars including Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, Kimberlé Crenshaw, and Cheryl Harris. In addition to learning the key tenets of this theoretical framework, students will also use it to think across disciplines, institutional structures, and forms of media.",Winter,"RDIN 22900, CRES 12900",,Danielle Jones
ENGL 23002,Technê and Technique. 100 Units.,"In European thought, the relationship between technê (craft or art) and epistêmê (knowledge) has long been a fraught one. Crucially, the practical knowledge associated with skill or art in making is often subordinated to more abstract forms of knowledge production such as mathematics or philosophy itself; and in the sphere of art, poets and critics often make a distinction between 'mere' technique and higher or unmediated forms of artistic expression. In this course, we will examine philosophical and artistic assumptions and arguments about technê, technics, and technique by staging a broad conversation between poets and philosophers; and we will consider recent discussions of technê and the impact that modern scientific technology has on the nature of thinking and artistic making. Readings will be drawn from philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, and Heidegger, and from poetic works ranging from ancient epics to Wallace Stevens and beyond. Final projects may include critical essays, creative projects, or creative/critical works.",Spring,"DVPR 43002, ENGL 43002, RLST 23002",,Ryan Coyne and Srikanth Reddy

Their voices, along with Indigenous queer and feminist scholars in academia, have been working to understand the interrelatedness of gendered violences, land dispossession, and cultural appropriation. This class will consider how Indigenous feminist, queer, and Two Spirit scholars have theorized gender, sexuality, race, and colonialism alongside queer and feminist of color critiques toward accountable visions of resistance. We will read works by Indigenous feminist scholars, writers, poets, and activists from the nineteenth-century to the twenty-first to consider how Indigeneity challenges how gender and sexuality are experienced in the context of ongoing settler colonialism.",,"ENGL 33101, RDIN 33100, GNSE 20152, GNSE 30152, RDIN 23100",,
ENGL 23120,Translation Theory and Practice. 100 Units.,"This course introduces students to the field of Translation Studies and its key concepts, including fidelity, equivalence, and untranslatability, as well as the ethics and politics of translation. We will investigate the metaphors and models that have been used to think about translation and will consider translation as a transnational practice, exploring how ""world histories"" may be hidden within ""word histories,"" as Emily Apter puts it. In the process, we will assess theories of translation and poetry from classical antiquity to the present; compare multiple translations of the same text; and examine notable recent translations. Students will regularly carry out translation exercises and create a final translation project of their own. (20th/21st)",Spring,ENGL 36210,,Rachel Galvin
ENGL 23306,Writing after Windrush. 100 Units.,"Writing After Windrush"" explores the legacies of Windrush in fiction and poetry, visual arts, and social movements, interpreting ""writing"" as a broad range of media and discourse. Beginning with Henry Swanzy, Una Marson, and their leadership on the BBC radio show Caribbean Voices, we will engage with the creative works of Windrush migrants and their descendants: Trinidadian British novelist Samuel Selvon, Jamaican British dub poet Linton Kwesi Johnson, Guyanese British mixed-media artist Hew Locke, and others. To understand social struggle, we will study the life of activist Claudia Jones and her founding of the West Indian Gazette And Afro-Asian Caribbean News. We will consider the memory of Windrush through the moving image, in Steve McQueen's 2020 anthology series Small Axe. Finally, we will examine the 2018 Windrush Scandal, in which at least 83 Britons were unjustly deported, in conversation with works like Hazel Carby's account of the intertwined histories of Jamaica and Britain, Imperial Intimacies (2019). Throughout, we will travel throughout London for museum and studio visits, food, and more. (Fiction, 1830-1990)",Autumn,,Admission to the London Study Abroad Program,Kaneesha Parsard

ENGL 24119,Literature and Citizenship. 100 Units.,"What we think of as modernity can be said to begin with the birth (or rebirth) of the citizen. During the 17thand 18th centuries, revolutions in Britain, France, and North America sought to recast political society as a structure built upon social contracts and natural rights of the people rather than the divine right of kings. Yet the category of citizen was (and remains) exclusionary as well as inclusive, frequently deployed to mark those outside its boundaries and protections. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the constructions of race, gender, and nation continued to shift into new forms, and many literature of these centuries focus on how ""the citizen"" is conceived and reinvented into the present. This interdisciplinary, trans-historical, and transatlantic course will discuss how these tensions and debates influence literature and political discourse over four centuries, a breadth that will allow us to trace the concepts and critiques of citizenship as they have come to shape our contemporary world. Primary readings will include William Shakespeare, Tobias Smollett, Olaudah Equiano, Anna Laetitia Barbauld, Herman Melville, Frederick Douglass, Richard Wright, Miné Okubo, and Claudia Rankine.

Is black quietude a moment of universalism that transcends the determinations of race? Or do black subjects carry or project the experience of racialization into their spaces of quiet? Do we define quiet for the black subject on the same terms as for other racial categories? (Theory),Winter,CRES 24252,,Tina Post
ENGL 24255,America's Literary Scientists. 100 Units.,"This course targets in on the entanglements between science and literature during the nineteenth and early twentieth century in America-a historical moment when these realms did not appear nearly as divided as they do now. In particular, we attend to the period's exciting developments in biology, which promised to revolutionize contemporary notions of human being. Our analysis of American fiction will center on the subjects and methods that writers adopted (imaginatively and often critically) from fields like evolutionary science, microbiology, and experimental psychology. But the course syllabus also includes American scientists who wrote fiction: What types of knowledge did they hope to produce in becoming literary? The aim of our inquiry will, in large part, be to examine the role of literature in shaping the significance of science in American culture, as well as the role of science in helping to build an American literary canon. Along the way, we will track the kinds of experiments in form and genre that such literary-scientific hybrids might produce. Readings may include works by Henry Adams, W.E.B. Du Bois, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Oliver Wendell Holmes, William James, Silas Weir Mitchell, Mark Twain, and Edith Wharton. Theoretical and critical works will be drawn from the history of science, science and technology studies, and nonhuman studies.",Spring,"MAPH 34255, ENGL 34255",,Agnes Malinowska
ENGL 24526,Forms of Autobiography in the Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries. 100 Units.,"This course examines the innovative, creative forms autobiography has taken in the last one hundred years in literature. We will study closely works written between 1933 and 2013 that are exceptional for the way they challenge, subvert and invigorate the autobiographical genre. From unpublished sketches to magazine essays and full-length books, we will see autobiography take many forms and engage with multiple genres and media. These include biography, memoir, fiction, literary criticism, travel literature, the graphic novel and photography. Producing various mutations of the autobiographical genre, these works address some of the same concerns: the self, truth, memory, authenticity, agency and testimony. We will complement discussions of these universal issues with material and historical considerations, examining how the works first appeared and were received. Autobiography will prove a privileged site for probing constructions of family narratives, identity politics and public personas. The main authors studied are Virginia Woolf, Gertrude Stein, James Baldwin, Vladimir Nabokov, Roland Barthes, Paul Auster, Doris Lessing, Marjane Satrapi and W.G. Sebald.

ENGL 24528,Seeing Ourselves: Photography and Literary Non-Fiction. 100 Units.,"What knowledge about ourselves can photographs provide? Can photographs change the way we see ourselves--collectively, individually? Photography has been around for almost 200 years, yet its dominance in our lives seems only to increase. This course examines photography's influence on our everyday lives, particularly on conceptions and portrayals of the self. We will see how theorists have grappled with the phenomenon of photography, engaging the written word to address its conundrums, dangers, and attractions. With the help of these theorists, we will question the promises that photographs seem to make about representing the world. The purpose of this course is also, however, to take seriously the affective, documentary power of photography. We will thus analyze the creative use of photographs in the non-fiction (or nearly non-fiction) of major 20th- and 21st-century writers (philosophers, critics, journalists, essayists, poets, novelists, activists). Photography will emerge as a productive medium for navigating issues of memory, identity, race, gender, authenticity, agency, publicity, and art. With keen attention to the different capabilities of writing and photography, we will explore the dynamics of self-expression, the ethics of representing others, and the politics of image-text depictions.

ENGL 24540,Islands and Otherness. 100 Units.,"The island as a space of possibility - of discovery, of (re)imagination, and of otherness - is a concept with a very long history in Anglophone literature. Indeed, Britain's own archipelagic geography (a landscape unique among Europe's imperial powers) has often been invoked for a range of rhetorical ends. John of Gaunt's famous speech in Richard II uses the idea of Britain as the ""scepter'd isle"" as both a source of comfort (England as especially favored) and the foundation of critique (favor squandered). With the rise of transoceanic empires, writers throughout Great Britain, its colonial dominions, and other literary traditions imbued the symbol of the island with ever-increasing layers of meaning. Yet the island was also always already a location of anxiety, hostility, and liminality - of alternate cultural practices and systems of belief, of indigenous peoples who refused the claims of the colonizer, and where the meaning of Europe itself was destabilized in the colonial encounter. While eighteenth- and nineteenth-century European writers often deployed the island to think through the implications of empire for the metropole, anticolonial writers turned to the island as a site of resistance and recuperation. This transhistorical course will discuss the many significations of the island in metropolitan, colonial, and postcolonial literature as a lens into the conflicts and debates of imperialism.",Spring,"ENGL 34540, MAPH 34540",,Tristan Schweiger

Why do we treat dogs like family and kill flies without a second thought? Why do animals appear so frequently as metaphors in our everyday speech? In this course, students will explore these questions by reading texts featuring animals in literature, scripture, and theory, ranging from the Bible, Zora Neale Hurston, and Franz Kafka to Flannery O’Connor and J.M.

ENGL 25318,Literary Radicalism and the Global South: Perspectives from South Asia. 100 Units.,"What does it mean to speak of literary radicalism? What are the hallmarks of a radical literature? And how does any such body of radical literature relate to the crucial question of empire, while also seeking to not be limited by that address? This course will explore the theme of literary radicalism through perspectives arising from South Asia. Over the twentieth century the subcontinent has been shaped through a wide variety of social and political movements: from anticolonial struggles to communist organising, feminist struggles, anti-caste mobilisation, indigenous protest and more, with their histories intertwining in different ways. We will start with a consideration of some texts on literary radicalism from other parts of the global South by authors such as Julia de Burgos and Ngugi Wa Thiong'o, and then move through a detailed discussion of South Asian texts every week to examine particular aspects of literary style and history. We will study texts from a variety of subcontinental languages (in translation, unless originally in English), and across different forms - poetry, short fiction, children's literature, novels, a memoir, a graphic novel and a documentary film on a poet.",Spring,SALC 25318,,Abhishek Bhattacharyya
ENGL 25320,"Debate, Dissent, Deviate: Literary Modernities in South Asia. 100 Units.","This class introduces students to the modernist movement in post-independence South Asia. Modernism will be understood here as a radical experimental movement in literature, film, photography and other arts, primarily aimed at critiquing mainstream narratives of history and culture. Given its wide scope, we will analyze a variety of texts over the ten-week duration of the class. These include novels, short stories, manifestos, essays, photographs, and films. The chronological span of the class is from the 1930s to the 1970s. Our aim will be to understand the diverse meanings of modernism as we go through our weekly readings. Was it a global phenomenon that was adopted blindly by postcolonial artists? Or were there specifically South Asian innovations that enable us to think about the local story as formative of global modernism? What bearings do such speculations have on genre, gender, and medium, as well as on politics? I will help situate the readings of each week in their specific literary and political contexts. Students will be able to evaluate, experiment with, and analyze various forms of modernist literary expressions emerging out of South Asia. This class will provide them with critical tools to interpret, assess, compare, and contrast cultural histories of non-Western locations and peoples, with an eye for literary radicalism.

Over the last few decades, writers and designers have experimented with text, video, audio, design, animation, and interactivity in unprecedented ways, producing new types of narratives about a world transformed by computers and communications networks. These artists have explored the cultural dimensions of information culture, the creative possibilities of digital media technologies, and the parameters of human identity in the network era. This course investigates the ways that new media have changed contemporary society and the cultural narratives that shape it. We will explore narrative theory through a number of digital or digitally-inflected forms, including cyberpunk fictions, text adventure games, interactive dramas, videogames, virtual worlds, transmedia novels, location-based fictions, and alternate reality games. Our critical study will concern issues such as nonlinear narrative, network aesthetics, and videogame mechanics.

Students will learn how to consider the visual register in novels, and how the drive to make fiction ""real,"" or ""photographic,"" helps to shed light on many attendant issues - the question of evidence, the problem of reliability, the terms of objectivity. We will discuss the drive to narrate real events in photographic and literary terms, and the limits of representation. Furthermore, we will think carefully about how discourses of race and poverty are imbricated with the development of photographic technologies and methods, and how racial groups such as American Indians are invented and reinvented in the advent of the mobile camera.

We will reflect on genre as concept en route: how did generic conventions and strategies organize this knowledge of unknown lands, other peoples, and distant marvels? We will read medieval texts like Book of Margery Kempe, Mandeville's Travels, and the Digby play of Mary Magdalene, along with medieval and modern literary theory, to survey how vernacular literature presented a picture of the world and charted paths across it.

ENGL 27015,Graphic Medicine: Comic Creation as Knowledge Formation. 100 Units.,"What does the medium of comics contribute to our knowledge and understanding of illness, disability, caregiving, and disease? How can making comics help us form individual and community knowledge about our bodies and health? This is a course designed to introduce students to the basic concepts and practices of the field of graphic medicine. To do this, we will closely engage with the elements and process of making comics as applied to the goals, principles, and applications of graphic medicine in particular, but also in relation to the health humanities. Broadly defined as the ""intersection between the medium of comics and the discourse of healthcare,"" graphic medicine allows for unique explorations of health, disease, and illness through the use of sequential images and textual elements within a narrative structure. Students will learn about conceptual and practical aspects of the field. Through critical analysis and discussion of key works, they will also be exposed to a variety of styles, genres, and applications that capture the breadth and diversity of graphic medicine. An important component of the class will be exercises through which students will create their own graphic medicine works as a way to explore knowledge formation about health, illness, and one's body through comics-making.

ENGL 27533,"Fugitive Poetics: Slaves, Runaways, Exiles, and Nineteenth-Century American Poetry. 100 Units.","This course considers late-eighteenth- and nineteenth-century American poetry from the perspective of the disprized. One central point of discussion will be how slavery and indentured servitude-and the attendant urge for escape and freedom from these and other carceral institutions-shaped the American poetic imaginary. We will take up both the poetry and poetic theory written by fugitives and explore poetry itself as a form of fugitivity for the enslaved, politically exiled, or ideologically confined. Central figures in the traditional canon of nineteenth-century U.S. poetry-Poe, Whitman, and Dickinson-will be considered from this vantage alongside figures like Harriet Jacobs, Frances E. W. Harper, José María Heredia y Heredia, and José Martí, among others. In the process, we will explore the potential connections and collisions between these nineteenth-century literary texts and contemporary lyric and critical race theory. This course is as interested in the nineteenth-century construction of a national American poetics as it is in American poetry itself; equal weight will be given to poetry and prose. Topics will include the poetic imaginary in early American statecraft, prosody and the carceral condition (what Max Cavitch calls ""Slavery and its Metrics""), blackface lyrics and class mobility, abolitionism, and inter-American literary exchange.",Spring,CRES 27533,,Jake Fournier
ENGL 27537,"Poetry for the People"": Global Black Politics and Culture in the Age of Marcus Garvey. 100 Units.","When Jamaican activist Marcus Garvey established the Universal Negro Improvement Association, he at once catalyzed a global mass movement for racial equality, projected a new Black diasporic identity, and redrew the fault-lines of modern racial politics. He also created the organizational and ideological framework for a global Black literature. Poets, workers, and political organizers from across the Black Diaspora sent both poetic and prosaic expressions of race-consciousness to the pages of Garvey's newspaper Negro World. These writers and activists challenged the legitimacy of world white supremacy, developed new modes of transnational racial affiliation, and enshrined Africa as the normative symbolic center of global Black politics. Despite its historical importance, however, Garveyism occupies an ambiguous place in African American studies. Controversies that trace back to the inception of UNIA, in addition to the loss of the organization's records, have impeded a full reckoning with the movement's global impact. Nonetheless, the great multivolume anthology of UNIA papers edited by Robert A. Hill, in addition to recent revisionist scholarship, suggest unexplored avenues of inquiry. The history of Garveyism, it seems, remains unfinished. ""Poetry for the People"" will introduce students to the real and imagined worlds of Garveyist Pan-Africanism, and explore the legacies of Garvey's movement for contemporary debates on race, empire, nationalism, and the politics of culture.",Spring,CRES 27537,,Noah Hansen
ENGL 27554,Unfinished Business: Revenge and Narrative Form. 100 Units.,"What does it mean for something-a concept, an object, a historical inheritance-to ""return with a vengeance""? Is revenge motivated by a desire for justice-a clear if ruthless commitment to equivalence-or does it demonstrate a drive towards excess? Does revenge restore order to a system of accounting, or does it compound wrongs that could never have been righted in the first place? Whom exactly is the post-breakup ""revenge body"" for? As these questions suggest, revenge possesses a special knack for confusing categories of self and other, and resurrecting uncertainties when it comes to cause and effect. Its resistance to closure makes it a complex model for social relation and narrative form. Revenge also has no respect for scale. Making no pretension to being impersonal or detached, revenge is linked to more minor forms like pettiness or grudges. Yet revenge plots often address scales far beyond the personal: events or contexts unfolding at the register of the historical, the intergenerational, the global. Revenge thus undoes unsustainable dichotomies between subject and object, social and individual, and more. We will explore revenge in novels and films alongside theories of revenge: psychoanalytic theories of fixation and the refusal to mourn, queer theorists and affect theorists writing on disaffection and alien affects, and even self-help writers counseling against the self-destructive, corrosive effects of not letting something go.",Winter,"CRES 27554, GNSE 27544",,Shirl Yang
ENGL 27555,Forms of Labor in Caribbean Literature. 100 Units.,"From the barrack-yard fiction of C.L.R. James to the Haitian peasant novel, Caribbean literature has been deeply preoccupied with the lives and struggles of the region's working people: Caribbean literature is, in many ways, a literature of labor. This course facilitates critical engagement with the role of labor in Caribbean literature, exploring how transformations in the conditions of work shape the development of regional literary trends from the early twentieth century through the 1960s. During this period, Caribbean writers identified the project of a national literature with the native working classes even while economic pressures led many to seek work abroad. How do Caribbean writers make sense of these contradictions? What strategies do poets and novelists employ to reconcile processes of transnational migration with narratives of national identity? This course surveys literatures produced across the Caribbean archipelago, comparing the varied forms and genres adopted by Haitian, Bajan, Trinidadian, Jamaican, and Guyanese writers to represent the working classes of their respective islands. Lectures and supplementary critical readings will situate literary texts in relation to histories of economic development in the Caribbean, with particular attention to the plantation, the peasantry, and the expansion of U.S. imperialism. Authors on the syllabus are likely to include Claude McKay, Eric Walrond, Jacques Roumain, C.L.R. James, George Lamming, and Sylvia Wynter.",Winter,"CRES 37555, CRES 27555",,Noah Hansen

ENGL 27703,Queer Modernism. 100 Units.,"This course examines the dramatic revisions in gender and sexuality that characterize the early twentieth century in the U.S. and Europe. Together, we will read literary texts by queer writers to investigate their role in shaping the period's emergent regimes of sex and gender. We'll consider queer revisions of these concepts for their effect on the broader social and political terrain of the early twentieth century and explore the intimate histories they made possible: What new horizons for kinship, care, affect, and the everyday reproduction of life did modernist ideas about sex and gender enable? Our examination will center primarily on queer lives relegated to the social and political margins-lives of exile or those cut short by various forms of dispossession. Towards the end of the quarter, we will also consider how more recent cultural producers-and in particular Black filmmakers associated with the New Queer Cinema movement- have sought to imagine or in some sense recover queer lives and scenes that have been silenced or apparently lost to history. This class will double as an advanced introduction to queer theory, with a particular emphasis on literary criticism and cultural studies.

Why do we find literature valuable? What do we ask from it, and what is it able to provide? Is art's very uselessness the key to its role in the lives of readers? Or can we expect literature to effect changes in the world we live in? Does literature serve a therapeutic function? An expressive one? To what or whom is a writer responsible? Students will develop their own answers to these questions, and also examine how attitudes about the function of literary text have changed over the last few centuries- centuries that have seen a staggering transformation in the growth of literacy and the volume of print and digital culture. Readings will range from the Renaissance to the 21st century, and may include texts by Philip Sidney, Oscar Wilde, William Faulkner, Elizabeth Bishop, James Baldwin, Jaques Ranciere, and Gayatri Spivak",Spring,"MAPH 47711, ENGL 47711",,Sarah Kunjummen

ENGL 27716,In a Queer Time and Place. 100 Units.,"In this class, we orient ourselves around the so-called ""temporal turn"" in queer and trans studies, which has produced some of the most exciting and influential queer theory of the last twenty years. We investigate queer theory's bold interventions into the political and ideological workings of temporality alongside important works of queer and trans literature and film spanning the 1990s to the present. Our texts collectively interrogate the assumed naturalness of straight time and question the ways that heteronormative imperatives around things like maturity, generation, marriage, and progress dictate what counts as a good life, a future worth having, or a history worth remembering. Together we chart queer modes of engagement with history, the archive, the temporality of gender and sex performance, the pace and rhythm of human development, and the times and spaces of sex and intimacy. This class offers students a graduate-level introduction to queer theory and a good starting point for academic inquiry into c20-21 queer and trans literature and cinema.

ENGL 27815,Appropriations and Impostures. 100 Units.,"What are the different aesthetic and literary uses of appropriation? The editor of a Canadian magazine who set up the Appropriation Prize in 2017, defended the practice of cultural appropriation by insisting that ""anyone, anywhere, should be encouraged to imagine other peoples, other cultures, other identities."" This case underscores the continuing tension between narrative as a vehicle for imagining and empathizing with distant others, and notions of cultural property. In this course, we look at a selection of literary works that speak to these themes including Diderot, Ern Malley, Patricia Highsmith, Peter Carey, Kenneth Goldsmith, and Sherman Alexie, with particular attention to the work of appropriation in postcolonial contexts. We also touch on appropriation in other media, such as for instance, Richard Prince's ""New Portraits,"" Sherrie Levine's ""After Walker Evans"", and Ni Haifeng's installations.",Spring,"MAPH 37815, ENGL 37815",,Darrell Chia

What are the claims made on behalf of literary texts in orienting us to other lives and possibilities, and in registering the experiences of displacement under global capitalism? To better answer these questions, we read recent scholarship that engages the field in conversations around gender, affect, climate change, and democracy, to think about the impulses that animate the field, and to sketch new directions. We survey the trajectories and self-criticisms within the field, looking at canonical critics (Fanon, Said, Bhabha, Spivak), as well as reading a range of literary and cinematic works by writers like Jean Rhys, E.M.

ENGL 29705,Incarcerated Life. 100 Units.,"The United States today is in the midst of an incarceration crisis, one in which millions of Americans are currently warehoused within, or have passed through, carceral institutions. Many scholars locate the emergence of this punitive turn in the 1970s, and with good reason: the landscape of penality and confinement looks much different in earlier historical periods. Turning to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, this course will explore literary, philosophical, and pragmatic engagements with the prison across the British Empire and in the postcolonial United States. By tracing the particular fears and fantasies that grouped around institutions of confinement, we will explore the logic by which an institution once marginal to social life has become so central to society that incarceration is now a conventional form of life. This course will involve a robust research component, culminating in a final paper; while this course is rooted in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, students will be welcome to pursue research on contemporary regimes of incarceration.

Building upon diverse approaches to environmental history and philosophy, the history of science, and cultural studies, this discussion-based course surveys the major frameworks through which the environment has been understood, investigated, and transformed since the origins of global modernity. Because of its outsized impact (intellectually and materially) on the globe, North American environmentalism and understandings of nature are used as our point of departure. Starting with debates about what to name our current epoch, the course approaches shifting definitions of environmental knowledge through decreasing scales of analysis, from the global, to communities and ecosystems, to species and individuals, ending with the microscopic. The course asks questions such as: What historical and cultural trends shape our current understandings of nature and the environment? At what scales can and should we intervene to shift the ways we know and interact with the natural world? How and to whom should the answers to these complex questions be communicated? Grades will be based on attendance, in-class participation, assigned discussion leading, written papers, and a final project organized as an exhibition proposal.",Autumn,"CEGU 20002, HIST 25032, GLST 21002",,Jessica Landau

In essence, we will look at the Midewin as an environmental humanities problem, asking the questions: What does it mean to restore a landscape or an ecosystem? What values or biases are in place in ecological restoration and how do we overcome them? The Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie, managed by the US Forest Service, is a restored prairie on the former site of the WII era Joliet Army Ammunition Plant. Throughout the September Term, we will visit the site several times to meet with Forest Service employees, participate in environmental restoration work, collect data for ecological studies, and learn more about the complicated history of the prairie and efforts to restore it.

ENST 21207,Ecocentrism and Environmental Racism. 100 Units.,"The aim of this course is to explore the tensions and convergences between two of the most profoundly important areas of environmental philosophy. ""Ecocentrism"" is the view that holistic systems such as ecosystems can be ethically considerable or ""count"" in a way somewhat comparable to human persons, and such a philosophical perspective has been shared by many prominent forms of environmentalism, from Aldo Leopold's Land Ethic to Deep Ecology to the worldviews of many Native American and Indigenous peoples. For some prominent environmental philosophers, a commitment to ecocentrism is the defining test of whether one is truly an environmental philosopher. ""Environmental Racism"" is one of the defining elements of environmental injustice, the way in which environmental crises and existential threats often reflect systemic discrimination, oppression, and domination in their disproportionate adverse impact on peoples of color, women, the global poor, LGBTQ populations, and Indigenous Peoples. Although historically, some have claimed that ecocentric organizations such as Greenpeace have neglected the problems of environmental injustice and racism in their quest to, e.g., ""save the whales,"" a deeper analysis reveals a far more complicated picture, with many affinities and alliances between ecocentrists and activists seeking environmental justice.

ENST 21501,Theory and Practice in Environmental Organizing and Activism. 100 Units.,"This course explores how organizations-civic, private, governmental-working in the field of environmental advocacy construct, deploy and are shaped by distinct discourses governing relationships between nature and society. The environment is a field of social action in which organizations attempt to effect change in large domains like resource conservation, access, stewardship, and a basic right to environmental quality in everyday life. The work of effecting change in these complex domains can assume a variety of forms including public policy (through the agencies of the state), private enterprise (through the agency of the market), 'third sector' advocacy (through the agency of nonprofit organizations) and social activism (through the agency of social movements and community organizations). State, market, civil society and social movement organizations are where ideas are transmitted from theory to practice and back again in a recursive, dialectical process. These contrasting forms of organization have different histories, wellsprings and degrees of social power. Moreover, they bring different epistemologies to their claims about being legitimate custodians of nature-that is to say they can be understood genealogically. As such, organizations working to effect environment change are at once animated by and constitutive of distinct discourses governing the relationships between nature and society. The course explores how those distinct discourses are associated with a suite of different organizational realms of social action; the goal is trying to connect the dots between discursive formations and organizational forms.",Winter,"SSAD 21501, GLST 21501, MAPS 31101, HMRT 21501, SSAD 41501, CEGU 21501, CEGU 31501, RDIN 21501",,Mary Beth Pudup

In answering these questions, this course will equip students with tools to reckon with some of our planet's most pressing concerns, including climate change and biodiversity loss, and emphasize the importance of approaching these issues through an interdisciplinary lens that includes humanistic lines of inquiry. Throughout the course, students will explore different methods used in the environmental humanities to gain an understanding of this emergent discipline as well as learn tools and methods they can employ in their own scholarship. Rather than work on long term research projects, however, students will sample and practice a variety of approaches to environmental humanities research and apply them to targeted case studies.

ENST 22119,Ecofeminisms: Feminist Theory and Climate Justice. 100 Units.,"Ecofeminism, a term coined in 1974, was at the height of its popularity in the late twentieth century. It merged feminist concerns with environmental ones by highlighting the ways both nature and women had been continually oppressed by patriarchal institutions. But by the early 2000s, ecofeminism was essentially a dead movement, attacked for being too essentialist and not inclusive enough. Interestingly, global warming and climate change movements also seemed to lose steam around the same time. Yet, as many scientists and scholars now recognize, climate change is neither gender neutral nor does it affect all people equally; women and people of color often suffer the most when extreme climate events strike. This course examines theories of ecofeminism from the late 20th century to the present to draw connections between feminist struggles, racial inequalities, human rights concerns, and climate change. Through our readings, films, discussions, presentations, and research projects, we will track some common threads between feminist theories and climate justice like access to water, food, and healthcare; reproductive rights and reproductive justice; and displacement due to climate change. Some questions we will interrogate are: How is climate justice a feminist issue? How is environmental degradation and climate change a human rights issue? Do we need a new term, like intersectional environmentalism, for ecofeminism?",Spring,"GNSE 12119, HMRT 12119",,Caroline Heller
ENST 22207,Posthuman Becoming. 100 Units.,"This course introduces recent developments and advanced approaches in critical posthumanist thought. We will explore emerging theories and practices that renegotiate the human condition through critical inquiry into posthuman desires and the complicated relationship between human and non-human 'others,' including animals, plants and micro-organisms, waste and toxins, artificial life, and hyperobjects. By engaging diverse viewpoints that map the stakes of a non-anthropocentric politics of culture, such as new materialism, object-oriented ontology, and speculative realism, but also eco-feminism, queer performativity, and Indigenous epistemology, we will explore emerging techniques of mediation, communication, and representation that surrender to the relational identities of a posthuman becoming. A central premise of this exploration are post-disciplinary ways of knowing that make such imaginaries visible: in addition to discussing a substantial body of contemporary scholarship from the arts, humanities, and humanistic social sciences, the course includes a studio module that introduces a variety of research-creation methodologies for experimentation with curatorial, artistic, and activist practices.",Spring,"ARTV 30702, MADD 12208, ANTH 32208, KNOW 32208",,Andre Uhl

Using both classic and contemporary works, this course will highlight some of the fundamental and unavoidable philosophical questions presented by such environmental issues. Does the environmental crisis demand radically new forms of ethical and political philosophizing and practice? Must an environmental ethic reject anthropocentrism? If so, what are the most plausible non-anthropocentric alternatives? What counts as the proper ethical treatment of non-human animals, living organisms, or ecosystems? What do the terms ""nature"" and ""wilderness"" even mean, and should ""natural"" environments as such have ethical and/or legal standing? What fundamental ethical and political perspectives inform such approaches as the ""Land Ethic,"" ecofeminism, and deep ecology? Is there a plausible account of environmental justice applicable to both present and future generations? Are we now in the Anthropocene, and if so, is ""adaptation"" the best strategy at this historical juncture?

ENST 22301,Digital Geographies of Climate Justice. 100 Units.,"Struggles for climate and environmental justice are increasingly mediated by digital technologies and geospatial data, especially in the Global South. In Amazonia, for example, the plight of indigenous groups bearing the brunt of ecological dispossession and political violence by deforestation is frequently represented through remotely-sensed data showing time-series of canopy loss; in turn, these data are often prompted, groundtruthed, and mobilized by indigenous communities and affiliated activists in legal and political campaigns. In parallel, across the world ocean, countries across the Global South- from Papua New Guinea and Ecuador to Ghana- are partnering with watch-dog organizations using satellite imagery and GPS data to track illegal fishing and human rights abuses at sea, acting as an auxilliary ecological police force to identify and provide data to prosecute offending vessels. The proliferation of these digital geographic technologies and techniques pose a number of complex questions. Drawing on contemporary cases, experimental projects in ""forensic"" approaches to activism, and recent work in critical geography, aesthetics, STS, and political theory, this seminar will attempt to map out these digital geographies of climate justice as they emerge. The course will also involve introduction to entry-level remote sensing + GIS workflows (no prior experience required) in a pair of intensive workshops led by guest lecturers/practitioners.",Spring,"MAPH 32301, GLST 29301, CEGU 32301, CEGU 22301",,Alexander Arroyo

These texts, modern and ancient, are fraught with political, religious, and historical background. In this course, we will compare these texts, focusing on literary issues like narrative plot, the construction of characters, the literary devices used, and the role of the narrator in telling the story of the flood. We will attempt to ascertain why imaginings of a deluge are generative, while being attuned to the complex differences between the ancient narratives and their significantly different afterlives.

Art that attempts to represent non-human experience helps to orient environmentalism around radical and highly personal moments of inter-species empathy. Portraying non-human perspectives, we escape the abstraction of environmental data, and instead approach ecological entanglement on the level of individual imagination. Giving voice and human embodiment to nature is a theme in much 19th, 20th and 21st century creative writing (fiction/nonfiction) and performance work (theater, dance, puppetry). Accordingly, this class offers a broad survey of non-human representation in these arts with special attention to first-person narratives and embodiment of flora and fauna. The course draws on philosophers of mind (i.e. Shaviro's 'Discognition') and nature-science writing, plus contemporary performance projects and digital works by art/technology companies who deploy virtual reality and electronic media to explore the points of view of natural beings and systems. Reading about anthropomorphization and the problem of the subject in nature writing from Erasmus Darwin to the present will allow students to adopt a critical as well as appreciative eye toward this field of study and expression.

Despite their ubiquity, yet perhaps unsurprisingly, cryptozoological animals have received little scholarly attention. This course aims to change that! By taking cryptozoology seriously, or at least as a serious object of study, students in American Monsters will study the history of cryptid folklore to unearth the historical context surrounding each creature and apply ecocritical methodologies to these tales in order to uncover the cultural values that cryptozoological stories hold.

ENST 24000,Is It Ethical to Have Children in the Climate Crisis? 100 Units.,"Climate change is not just an urgent environmental crisis for scientists, engineers, and policy makers: it is a moral problem that also informs individual and intimate aspects of human life, including choices about reproduction and parenting. For example, a 2018 survey published in the New York Times found that young adults in the U.S. are having fewer children than they would otherwise prefer, in part due to concerns about climate change and overpopulation. In this course, we examine the moral dimensions of having and raising children in an era shaped by climate change, looking closely at two main questions: 1) Is it ethical to have children in light of the world that the next generation will inherit, which may include more extreme weather events, unvoluntary human migrations, diminished access to resources, and heightened insecurity? 2) Is it ethical to have children in the context of the affluent West, where consumptive human populations disproportionately contribute to the effects of climate change that impact the world's most vulnerable? We will examine various points of view on these questions, engaging material from the disciplines of environmental studies and ethics, science and technology studies, and religious and philosophical ethics. Responses from feminist, queer, Indigenous, Black, and religiously diverse authors (and intersections therein) will shape our course readings and discussions.",Spring,"GNSE 23154, CEGU 24000, HLTH 24000, RLST 24000, HIPS 24100, CCTS 21023",,Kristi Del Vecchio
ENST 24102,Environmental Politics. 100 Units.,"Politics determines not only what particular faction holds power, but the parameters upon which contests for power are conducted. Competing political factions may diverge in the details of the policies they favor, but may agree on a central organizing principle upon which their policy differences are contested. This course acknowledges that such principles exist and structure politics, economics, and social arrangements, but also challenges the notion that these are immutable, and argues that other principles could be substituted which would drastically change these arrangements. The course introduces students to alternative theories of economics, politics, and environmental policy that challenge mainstream notions of what is acceptable under the current structural and institutional constraints, including how the retreat to notions of realism and practicality place limits on changes necessary to preserve and protect the natural environment.",Spring,"PBPL 24102, CEGU 24102",,R.

ENST 24110,Nature and the Natural in the Middle Ages. 100 Units.,"In this course we will undertake a study of nature and ideas about what is ""natural"" centered around three main axes, and will adopt a variety of relevant critical perspectives (e.g., ecocriticism, studies of gender and sexuality, political theory) to support our analyses. First, we will explore nature as the created world of which humans are a part (as one of God's creations), yet from which they also stand apart (as sovereign caretakers). Second, we will examine how the diffusion of Aristotelian works (notably the Politics) in the later Middle Ages provided a justificatory framework for social and political hierarchies and practices of economic exploitation. Third, we will consider the intersection of nature with gender, sexuality, and reproduction, a topic complicated by the fact that Nature is itself represented, in allegorical terms, as a woman.",Course not offered in 24-25.,"FREN 24100, MDVL 24103, CEGU 24110, GNSE 24103, GNSE 34103, FREN 34100","Reading knowledge of French for all students.

ENST 24600,Introduction to Urban Sciences. 100 Units.,"This course is a grand tour of conceptual frameworks, general phenomena, emerging data and policy applications that define a growing scientific integrated understanding of cities and urbanization. It starts with a general outlook of current worldwide explosive urbanization and associated changes in social, economic and environmental indicators. It then introduces a number of historical models, from sociology, economics and geography that have been proposed to understand how cities operate. We will discuss how these and other facets of cities can be integrated as dynamical complex systems and derive their general characteristics as social networks embedded in structured physical spaces. Resulting general properties of cities will be illustrated in different geographic and historical contexts, including an understanding of urban resource flows, emergent institutions and the division of labor and knowledge as drivers of innovation and economic growth. The second part of the course will deal with issues of inequality, heterogeneity and (sustainable) growth in cities. We will explore how these features of cities present different realities and opportunities to different individuals and how these appear as spatially concentrated (dis)advantage that shape people's life courses. We will show how issues of inequality also have consequences at more macroscopic levels and derive the general features of population and economic growth for systems of cities and nations.",Autumn,"PBPL 24605, SOCI 20285, GISC 34600, GISC 24600, CEGU 24600",STAT 22000,Luis Bettencourt

The relatively brief history of this policy area, and the separate and distinct tracts in which public lands and pollution control issues are adjudicated, makes for a diverse and complex process by which humanity's impact on the natural world is managed and contained. This course focuses on how both types of environmental issues are addressed in each branch of the Federal government, the states and localities, as well as theories of how environmental issues arrived onto the public agenda and why attention to them is cyclical. Students are encouraged to understand the life cycle of public policy from its initial arrival on the public agenda to the passage of legislation to address adverse conditions, as well as how changes in the policy occur after the inevitable decline of intensive attention.",Autumn,"CEGU 24701, PBPL 24701",,R.

However, the resolution to issues and concerns shared in common by the nations of the world often faces obstacles based on access to wealth and resources, political and military power, and the demands of international economic institutions. While multinational agreements have been achieved and successfully implemented, resolutions to issues such as climate change have been harder to achieve. The course will look at the origins of international cooperation on environmental issues, several case studies of issues upon which the international community has attempted to bring about cooperative solutions (climate change, the ozone hole, climate refugees, etc.), and the work that regional associations of nations have done to jointly address shared environmental challenges. In addition, speakers from various consulates have addressed the class to discuss environmental policymaking in their countries.",Spring,"CEGU 24776, PBPL 24776",,R. Lodato
ENST 25000,"The Amazon: Literature, Culture, Environment. 100 Units.","From colonial travelers to contemporary popular culture, the Amazonian forest has been a source of endless fascination, greed and, more recently, ecological concern. The numerous actors that have been shaping the region, including artists, writers, scientists, anthropologists, indigenous peoples, and the extractive industry, among others, bring a multifaceted view of this region that has been described as the paradise on earth as much as a green hell. This course offers an overview of Amazonian history, cultures, and environmental issues that spans from the sixteenth to the twenty-first century. What are the major topics, works, and polemics surrounding the ways the Amazon has been depicted and imagined? How can the region's history help us understand the state of environmental policies and indigenous rights today? What can we learn about the Amazon from literature and film?

ENST 25705,Climate Ethics. 100 Units.,"Anthropogenic climate change is the largest challenge facing human civilization. Its physical and temporal scale and unprecedented complexity at minimum require extensions of existing ethical systems, if not new ethical tools. In this course we will examine how religious and philosophical ethical systems respond to the vast temporal and spatial scales of climate change. For instance, common principles of environmental ethics such as justice and responsibility are often reimagined in climate ethics even as they are central to the ethical analysis of its effects. In the course, we will take a comparative approach to environmental ethics, examining perspectives from secular Western philosophy, Christianity (Catholic and Protestant), Buddhist, and Indigenous thought. We will also look at a variety of ethical methods.

ENST 25715,The Bible and Ecology. 100 Units.,"In 2010, HarperCollins published The Green Bible, which claims to help readers ""understand the Bible's powerful message for the earth."" What precisely is the Bible's ""message for the earth""? Does the Bible even contain one unified message about the relationship between God, human beings, and the natural world? For many, the question of ""what the Bible says"" about the environment has become urgent in the midst of the intersecting environmental crises of our day, from global warming to the sixth mass extinction. And yet, there does not seem to be an easy answer to this question; the Bible has been used both to support ethics of conservation and to justify exploitation of the earth's resources. In this course, we will analyze key passages employed in contemporary discourse about the Bible and the environment from a historical-critical perspective. At the same time, we will investigate how these texts are being invoked today in support of various agendas. Along the way, we will discover and interrogate the profound influence of biblical cosmologies, anthropologies, and eschatologies in shaping attitudes towards the earth and its nonhuman inhabitants.

Mars is now the primary target for human exploration and colonization in the Solar System. How did this happen? What does this mean? What do we know about Mars, and what's at stake when we make knowledge about it? Combining perspectives from the social sciences and humanities, this course investigates how knowledge about Mars is created and communicated in not only science and technology fields but across public culture. A major focus will be learning how Mars has been embedded within diverse social and political projects here on Earth. Through reading-inspired group discussions and instructor-led experiential research projects, the course will move from the earliest visual observations of Mars to recent robotic missions on the planet's surface.

ENST 27002,Compiling and Mediating Environmental History. 100 Units.,"How do audiovisual media archives inform both the research and presentation of environmental history? Social media posts, fiction film, photographs from geological surveys, and urban field recordings all index historical environmental conditions. Artists and scholars enlist such archives to reanimate lost and changed landscapes for contemporary audiences, raising historiographical questions about how research excavates, extracts, and assembles both image and sound. This course looks at a series of documentary films and online media projects that enlist media to narrate histories of socio-ecological interaction. These projects explore site-specific environmental crises as they were deliberately or inadvertently recorded by media, including the toxic legacies of U.S. Imperialism, the extraction economy of South African apartheid, or how Hollywood films unconsciously document the long-term impacts of climate change. Students will analyze these media objects alongside readings in media historiographical theory, environmental history, and documentary theory. The goal of this engagement is to guide students toward a final project that employs both research and creative practice to compile a report about an environmental historical case study that utilizes a media archive to make the argument.

ENST 29400,Climate Change and Human Mobility. 100 Units.,"A 2021 UN report estimated that 21.5 million people have been forced to move, each year, for over a decade, due to climate change. The report states: ""weather-related crises have triggered more than twice as much displacement as conflict and violence in the last decade"" (UNHCR, 2021). In spite of mounting evidence that climate change is to blame for these catastrophic weather-related events and associated increases in migration, the UNHCR eligibility criteria for refugee status doesn't include climate change. Due to political challenges involved in considering such a definition change, the UN convened member states to establish a global compact for migration that takes the effects of climate change into consideration. The Global Compact suggests rights and obligations of climate change migrants, and standards to guide sovereign states in protecting these rights. Given the growth in climate change related migration over the last decade, and the complicated nature of implementation with such a broad international instrument such as the Global Compact, there is much room for development within the climate change and human mobility sector. This course will: examine the issue of climate change and its relationship to human mobility using human rights, political ecology, and social policy perspectives; consider how these different perspectives for understanding the problem suggest different types of policy solutions; and consider the impact of these solutions for those affected.",TBD,"CEGU 69400, CEGU 29400, CHST 29400, HMRT 39401, HMRT 29400, SSAD 69400, SSAD 29400",,

Through this course, students will gain foundational knowledge in the health effects of climate change. We will begin with several lectures on climate science as it related to the patterns of weather extremes experienced by populations. We will then identify the varying health outcomes linked to different climate-related exposures, emphasizing the specific impacts in vulnerable and high-risk populations. Specific topics include the effects of air pollution, extreme heat and heat waves, droughts, tropical cyclones, changes in vector habitats, and sea-level rise. Finally, we will discuss strategies for public health practitioners to aid communities in preventing or alleviating these adverse effects.",Autumn,"HLTH 21720, PBHS 31720, CEGU 31720",PBHS 32100 or STAT 22000 or introductory statistics,K.

CEGU 22100,"Disease, Health, and the Environment in Global Context. 100 Units.","Recent concerns about infectious diseases and the environmental determinants of health have attracted renewed attention to previous accounts of disease, many of which have significantly shaped human political, social, economic, and environmental history. Former examples include: respiratory diseases and sexually transmitted infections among Indigenous communities during the age of European exploration and colonial settlement; nutritional deficiencies resulting from the forced relocation and labor of enslaved Africans throughout the Atlantic World; ""filth"" diseases and urban sanitary reform during the Bacteriological Revolution; zoonotic diseases and pest control campaigns during imperial expansion projects across the Caribbean; and cancers borne of industrial pollutants in the modern era. Through readings, in-class discussions, and written assignments that culminate in a final project, students in this course will explore how natural and human-induced environmental changes have altered our past experiences with disease and future prospects for health. First, we will examine how early writers understood the relationship between geography, environment, hereditary constitution, race, gender, and human health. We will then analyze the symbiotic relationship among pathogens, human hosts, and their physical environments. Finally, we will explore how social factors and human interventions have influenced the distribution of infectious diseases and environmental health risks.",Spring,"GLST 22101, CEGU 32100, HIST 25033, HIPS 22210, HLTH 22100, RDIN 22100",,Christopher Kindell

This course takes a contemporary look into how urbanization affects planetary health, focusing on cities as sites of global resource extraction, waste generation, biodiversity loss, and increasing social inequality and climate vulnerability; but also as centers of population, innovation and social organization, which can facilitate climate solutions. Using a range of social science approaches and methods, students will consider critiques of historical urban planning and linear city resource economies, and analyze contemporary approaches related to climate action, green space planning, and nature-based solutions, with specific attention on environmental goals and equity outcomes. Through critical exploration of both historical urban planning, and contemporary frameworks for sustainable city agenda setting, students will consider the environmental past, present and future of global cities. In Autumn 2024, this course will be part of the Paris Urbanism Study Abroad program.

CEGU 22408,Climate (Long) Before Climate Change: The Environment According to Medieval Muslims and Christians. 100 Units.,"Few issues are currently considered more significant than ""climate change."" Like us, medieval people were concerned about climate. Unlike us, they understood a ""climate"" as a fixed, unchanging thing. Working between 1250 and 1500, this class examines climate as it was known between Latin and Arabic sources. In both Christian and Muslim scholarly communities, climate had its precedents in Ancient Greek works, so we'll linger in Iberia, an important conduit through which Latin Christians gained access to Greek ideas, largely by translating Arabic books. In these books, ""climate"" (which might differ from ""environment"") included familiar things: animals and plants, sunlight and rainfall, mineral resources and weather. Yet it also encompassed stranger ideas: magic, astrology/astronomy, and even some ideas we might now call ""religious"" or ""racist."" In our class, we consider how climate has long been a site of ""scientific"" inquiry and ""religious"" devotion, cultural confidence and fear of the unknown.",Spring,"RLST 25708, MDVL 22408, HIST 22408, HIPS 22408",,A.

FNDL 29205,The Simultaneity of Time: Reading Jorge Luis Borges in the 21st Century. 100 Units.,"Through complex and evolving perspectives of time, reading, language, and writing, Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986) developed both an ""ethics"" and a ""technics"" of the ""intellectual"" vis-à-vis literature, history, and philosophy. Over the 20th century, the political and cultural consideration of his ethics and technics varied depending on the moment, but the debates only increased Borges´ influence as a language crafter and as a thinker, beyond the language he chose to write (Spanish, he could have been an English writer, but he opted for Spanish). The course will seek to serve as a collective close reading of the prose works (fiction and non-fiction) by Jorge Luis Borges, relying on excellent editions and translations: J. L. Borges, Collected Fictions (Viking, Pinguin 1998), translated by Andrew Hurley, and Jorge Luis Borges, Selected Non-Fictions (Pinguin 2000), edited and translate by Eliot Weinberger, Esther Allen, Suzanne Jill Levine.

Is truth simply a problem of and for ""correct"" reasoning? What assumptions about argumentation and evidence go unexplored in this way of framing the problem? What if truth were a problem of truth-telling instead? When and how do social, racial, and gender hierarchies authorize received understandings of a (credible) truth-teller? What is credible telling usually thought to sound like? What are the conditions for listening and hearing the truth? To think through these questions, we take as a lens the archetype of Cassandra, the babbling prophetess of classical Greek myth and tragedy doomed not to be believed. Cassandra has served as a resource and source of inspiration for a range of critical thinkers, including but not limited to theorists, feminists, poets, and novelists. What is a ""Cassandra""? Does her ""deranged"" way of seeing the world - her prophetic speech - disorient or destabilize? We will consider how, in her different representations, Cassandra places questions of language, patriarchy, and sexual violence at the center of general discussions of credibility and critique.

FNDL 23810,Memory and Identity in French Literature: Proust to the Present. 100 Units.,"This introductory-level course takes as its point of departure Marcel Proust's conceptualization of memory as the foundation both for the self and for literature. For Proust, literary style conveys the singularity of an individual vision while rescuing experience from the contingencies of time. Literature, identity, and memory are inseparable. Later writers will follow Proust's lead in defining literature as an art of memory; but they develop this art in different ways, whether by inventing new forms of life-writing or attempting to revive, via fiction, a lived connection to history. How does memory serve as the foundation of individual or collective identities? How does fiction imagine and give form to memory, and how does literature serve as a medium for cultural memory? How do literary works register the intermittence of memory, its failings and distortions, its fragility as well as its attachment to bodies and places? We will tackle these questions through close analysis of a range of texts. In addition to Proust, authors studied may include Yourcenar, Perec, Modiano, Roubaud, and Ernaux.",Course not offered in 24-25.,"SIGN 26047, FREN 23810",,Alison James

He directed over 60 films and is known foremost for his ""essay films,"" a hybrid of documentary and personal reflection, which he invigorated if not invented with films like Lettre de Sibérie (Letter from Siberia, 1958) or Sans Soleil (Sunless, 1983). His most famous film, La Jetée (1962), his only (science) fiction film made up almost entirely of black-and-white still photographs, was the inspiration for Terry Gilliam's 12 Monkeys (1995). In 1990, he created his first multi-media installation, Zapping Zone, and in 1997 he experimented with the format of the CD-Rom to create a multi-layered, multimedia memoir (Immemory). In 2008, he continued his venture into digital spaces with Ouvroir, realized on the platform of Second Life. Marker was a passionate traveler who documented the journeys he took, the people he met, and revolutionary upheavals at home and afar.

Our principal aims will be to understand the problems Kant seeks to address and the significance of his famous doctrine of ""transcendental idealism"". Topics will include: the role of mind in the constitution of experience; the nature of space and time; the relation between self-knowledge and knowledge of objects; how causal claims can be justified by experience; whether free will is possible; the relation between appearance and reality; the possibility of metaphysics.

We'll consider the effect of Richardson's decision to conduct his novel as a series of letters, and we'll pay particular attention to his extraordinary effectiveness in creating complexity in a fairly simple plot and in tracking an ever-expanding cast of characters. The Penguin edition we'll be using comes to 1499 pages, and they are over-sized pages. This is a course for committed readers!

How do we at once pay homage to and overcome a time-honored past without severing our ties to history altogether? Is Petrarch's model still viable today in efforts to forge a new beginning? We will pay special attention to Petrarch's fraught relationship with religious and secular models such as Saint Augustine and Cicero, to Petrarch's legacy in notable Renaissance humanists (Pico, Poliziano, Erasmus, Montaigne, etc.), and to the correlation of Petrarchan inquiry with modern concerns and methodologies in textual and social analysis, including German hermeneutics (Gadamer) and critical theory (Gramsci).",,"ITAL 28500, ITAL 38500",,Rocco Rubini

For centuries it was the emblem in Europe of what it meant to have a civilization. The poem tells the story of the mythical foundation of Rome, and asks questions about the nature of civilization with an insight and clarity rarely equaled in literary fiction: How much suffering can be perpetuated before the project of civilization turns inside out? How much fiction is legitimate in a story of national origins? Why do we need stories of national origins in the first place? The majority of the quarter will be devoted to The Aeneid. We will conclude by reading the opening movement of Hermann Broch's The Death of Virgil, written during the Nazi years and published in 1944, in which his fictional Virgil reflects on his achievement in The Aeneid and asks for his poem to be destroyed.",Winter,,,"Payne, Mark"
FNDL 23907,Gandhi and His Critics. 100 Units.,"The moral and political writings of M.K. Gandhi constitute one of the most influential archives of ethics in the twentieth century. For a man so devoted to periodic vows of silence and withdrawal, he nevertheless left over ninety volumes of public speeches, personal correspondence, and published essays. A modernist arrayed against the brutalities of modernity, Gandhi's thought encompassed concepts of sovereignty, the state, self and society, religion, civilization, and force. His insistence on cultivating technologies of the self as a response to both colonial and intimate violence was inspired by an eclectic range of source material. Generations of critical thinkers from around the world, including Black, feminist, Communist, and Dalit political activists, engaged with his ideas.

Their life stories provide the contexts for the sharp differences and surprising commonalities in their political thought and religious beliefs. At the end of their lives, were they still radical contrasts, sharing the same views, or had their beliefs shifted - did Malcolm become Martin and Martin become Malcolm?",Winter,"RLST 24601, HIST 27209, RDIN 24601, AMER 24601",,Dwight Hopkins

Primo Levi is a polyhedral author, and this course revisits his work in all its facets. We will privilege the most hybrid of his texts: The Search for Roots, an anthology that collects the author's favorite readings--a book assembled through the books of the others, but which represents Levi's most authentic portrait. By using this work as an entry point into Levi's universe, we will later explore his other texts, addressing issues such as the unsettling relationship between survival and testimony, the ""sinful"" choice of fiction, the oblique path towards autobiography, and the paradoxes of witnessing by proxy.",Winter,"ITAL 24920, JWSC 24920, ITAL 34920",Open to advanced undergrads with consent of instructor.,Maria Anna Mariani

We will explore the views on Eros presented in the various speeches comprising the dialogue, among them: love's relationship to physical beauty and human desire; its potential for prompting heroic action and forging moral education; its significance for the soul and place in the cosmos. We will also analyze the literary aspects of the work (plot, action, allegory); the dialogue's historical setting (democratic Athens beset by domestic conspiracies and engaged in an apocalyptic war); its implications for political philosophy; and the function of a symposium in classical Athens. We will devote several sessions at the end of term to major interpretations of the dialogue.",Winter,"PLSC 25807, PLSC 35807",,"D. Kasimis, J. McCormick"
FNDL 25502,Simone de Beauvoir as Philosopher. 100 Units.,"This class will survey the philosophical work of twentieth-century Existentialist thinker Simone de Beauvoir. Best known as the author of the landmark second-wave feminist book, The Second Sex, de Beauvoir wrote extensively on topics in ethics, politics, and phenomenology. She also published several novels, one of which (The Mandarins) won the prestigious Prix Goncourt. Even so, the vast majority of de Beauvoir's work is rarely studied in either France or the United States. Our goal in this class will be to take de Beauvoir seriously as one of the most important philosophical thinkers of the twentieth century. We will aim to understand her intellectual program holistically, with emphasis on the way in which her Existentialist concerns informed her work in literature and feminism. Works to be read include The Ethics of Ambiguity, The Second Sex, The Mandarins, Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter, and selected essays.

Their writings-including their co-authored book-address pressing questions about politics, religion, race, education, film, and gender. In different ways, they each find resources for hope, love, and liberation in an unjust social order. In this course, we will read selections from their writings over the last forty years alongside the authors who influenced their thinking (including Du Bois, Freire, Morrison, King, and Baldwin). We will pay special attention to how hooks and West communicate to popular audiences, how they engage religious traditions (their own and others'), and the role of dialogue in their thought and practice. The goal of the course is not just to think about hooks and West, but to think with them about ethics, writing, American culture, and the aims of education.

First, we will examine Bergson's Creative Evolution. In addition to evaluating this work in the light of modern evolutionary biology, we will examine its view of life and of time in the context of Augustine's concepts of creation and time in Book XI of Confessions. Second, we will examine Bergson's Matter and Memory. In addition to evaluating this work in the light of modern neuroscience, we will examine its view of the incorporeality of the intellect in relation to a similar concept in Thomas Aquinas (the first part of his Treatise on Human Nature in Summa Theologica Part I, Questions 75-89).",Winter,RLST 23974,,Stephen C.

The very middleness of the Purgatorio provides Dante the opportunity to explore a variety of problems dealing with our life here, now, on earth: contemporary politics, the relationship between body and soul, poetry and the literary canon, art and imagination, the nature of dreams, and, of course, love and desire. The Purgatorio is also Dante's most original contribution to the imagination of the underworld, equally influenced by new conceptualizations of ""merchant time"" and by contemporary travel writing and fantastic voyages.",,"ITAL 32000, ITAL 22000, MDVL 22003",,H.

But before 1922 little was known about Cao, and interpreters of the novel were forced to make headway solely on the basis of textual clues. The so-called ""Three Commentators"" edition (_Sanjia ping Shitou ji_) shows these readers at their creative, polemical, and far-fetched best.

What is objectivity? What is irony? What is humor? What is the difference between the ethical and the religious? What is it to become and be a human being?

FNDL 29416,Dreaming and Interpreting. 100 Units.,"What is a dream? In this course, we will explore this ancient question through a close engagement with the founding texts of psychoanalysis. Sigmund Freud's The Interpretation of Dreams, published on the eve of the year 1900, offered a revoluntionary account of the human mind and imagination. We will read this challenging text in its entirety before turning to the powerful critique posed by Freud's contemporary, Carl Jung. Charismatic disciple turned adversary, Jung diverged from Freud to develop his own influential interpretation of dreams and what they reveal about the structure of the mind. As we chart the complex rivalry between these two great thinkers (and dreamers), we will try to understand how and why their mutually opposed theories are also closely intertwined. Among other topics, we will focus on the content and the form of dreams and dreaming; the image of the dream vs. the text of analysis; the stakes of interpretation, both theoretical and therapeutic; individual vs. collective symbols; the autobiographical elements in both Freud and Jung's theories of dreaming; and the relation between dreams and mental illness, madness, and trauma.

Written in the midst of the social disruption caused by the Black Death (1348), the ""Decameron"" may have held readers attention for centuries because of its bawdiness, but it is also a profound exploration into the basis of faith and the meaning of death, the status of language, the construction of social hierarchy and social order, and the nature of crisis and historical change. Framed by a storytelling contest between seven young ladies and three young men who have left the city to avoid the plague, the one hundred stories of Boccaccio's ""Decameron"" form a structural masterpiece that anticipates the Renaissance epics, Chaucer's ""Canterbury Tales,"" and the modern short story. Students will be encouraged to further explore in individual projects the many topics raised by the text, including (and in addition to the themes mentioned above) magic, the visual arts, mercantile culture, travel and discovery, and new religious practices.",Winter,"ITAL 23502, ITAL 33502, MDVL 23502",,H.

We examine in particular the historical redactions of the Canzoniere, its status as a work-in-progress, what Petrarch excluded from its various forms (especially the Rime disperse), early drafts, and authorial variants.

This course combines study of Hildegard's visionary writings with in-depth attention to the artistic, scientific, liturgical, and institutional context in which she worked.

FNDL 24806,History of Sexuality and Sin. 100 Units.,"Since Foucault's groundbreaking work on the History of Sexuality, we have become attuned to the effects of power and the political implications of the science of sexuality. While Foucault's text has offered a critical avenue to examine the secular state's administrations of sexuality, it begins with Christianity's techniques of power based on the confession of one's sex. The Christian formulation of the relationship between 'sex' and 'sin' is essential to understanding the techniques of power that connect sexuality, legality, criminality, normality, and transgression in modern secular contexts. In this class, we will begin with the critical questions of the History of Sexuality, then turn to primary texts in order to examine the way 'sex' and 'sin' became conceptually connected in Christianity, and finally interrogate the effects of this relation for medieval and modern politics. Over the course of these readings, we will trace the relation between the concepts and their effects to discern the histories of sexuality that lie at the root of contemporary debates on freedom, power, resistance, and desire.

Black Lives Matter protestors carried signs citing scriptural support for the rights of African Americans to life and justice, while some of those who stormed the U.S. Capitol on January 6th first marched around their state capitols in recreation of biblical Israel's circling of the doomed city Jericho. How can the same book serve the political ends of such ideologically distinct movements? In this course, we will explore the variety of ways in which the Bible, especially the Christian New Testament, informs contemporary political discourse. We will discuss what the Bible is and where it comes from, and how an interpreter's social location and culturally and historical-bound assumptions shape their interpretation. We will build upon this foundation by examining several contentious political issues in which the Bible is commonly invoked, including abortion, sexuality, immigration, and gun rights. We will analyze the key passages used by supporters of various policy positions to support their claims, situating these texts in their original contexts and highlighting the historical distance that problematizes their use today.

FNDL 25424,Spiritual Exercises: Giving Form to Thought and Life from Plato to Descartes. 100 Units.,"This course will examine the tradition of spiritual exercises from antiquity to the early modern period. Spiritual exercises were at the core of classical paideia, the regimen of self-formation designed and promoted by ancient philosophers, orators, and other pedagogues. As Pierre Hadot and Michel Foucault have demonstrated, ancient philosophy first and foremost has to be understood as a ""way of life,"" as a set of techniques and practices for shaping the self according to wisdom. It was not until philosophy's critical turn with Kant that it shed its practical dimension and became a ""theoretical"" discipline. Early Christianity, stylizing itself as the ""true philosophy,"" eagerly adopted the ancient spiritual exercises and retooled them for its salvational ends. Throughout the middle ages and early modern period spiritual exercises and meditative techniques informed a host of religious, cultural, and artistic practices and media such as prayer and devotional reading, religious art and poetry, but also theatrical performances and musical works. We will focus on individual exercises like the meditation, the examination of conscience, the discernment of spirits, the application of senses, prosoche (attention), consolation, contemplation, etc., and discuss authors such as Epictetus, Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, John Cassian, Augustine, Bonaventure, Ignatius, Descartes, and others.",Spring,"CMLT 25424, RLVC 35424, CMLT 35424, RLST 25424, GRMN 25424, CLCV 25423, CLAS 35423, COGS 22017, GRMN 35424",,Christopher Wild

FNDL 27002,Reading Augustine's Confessions. 100 Units.,"This course will carry out a close reading of Augustine's Confessions. We will study the work not only as a spiritual autobiography-a common approach-but also as a philosophical argument against alternatives to Christian faith and practice in the late fourth century. That argument will invite us to examine the implications of religious faith for human well-being and on how religious convictions affect the quality of human relationships, self-knowledge, and the emotions. We'll thus examine how Confessions interrogates the quality of human love, fear, hatred, and regret; moral responsibilities to ourselves and others; the (anxious) awareness that we are limited in body and time; and how to craft an honest narrative of self-understanding. We will ask (among other things), Is religion a source of personal healing and health, or an obstacle to it? What sorts of problems is religion meant to cure? What problems do religious beliefs create? How does religion bear on the self's loves, its past, its mortality, its doubts? Along the way we'll ask whether it is possible to want to do evil, whether it is possible to love or grieve too much, whether we are responsible for what happens in our dreams, what it means to be a friend to others-and how Augustine's answers to these questions presuppose a wider account of divine justice, charity, and the ordering of the cosmos.",Autumn,"MDVL 25102, RLST 25102",,Richard B.

The book is the only writing of Strauss's that deals with the whole corpus of a philosopher or poet. And it is the most intense and most demanding interpretation of Aristophanes a philosopher has presented up to now.

In chapter 1 (on Aristotle) politics is considered from the perspective of the citizen or statesman; in chapter 2 (on Plato's Republic) it is reflected on from the point of view of the philosopher; and in chapter 3 (on Thucydides' History) it is seen within the horizon of the prephilosophic political community. The center of the book is Strauss's dialogue with Plato's Republic. Strauss interprets ""the broadest and deepest analysis of political idealism ever made"" as a work of education. This education has a moderating effect on political ambition and leads its best readers to the philosophic life. The longest and perhaps most intriguing chapter, Strauss's discussion of Thucydides, focuses on the political life and leads up to the question ""what is a god?""",Spring,"PHIL 27325, CLCV 27422, CLAS 37422, SCTH 37325, PHIL 37325",Open to undergraduates with the instructor's consent.,Heinrich Meier

However, he did mark out his path of thought through autobiographical reflections on the decisive challenges to which his oeuvre responded. The philosophically most demanding confrontation that Strauss presented on the question of how he became what he was is the so-called Autobiographical Preface of 1965, which he included in the American translation of his first book, ""Spinoza's Critique of Religion"" (originally published in 1930). Two decades earlier, in the lecture The Living Issues of German Postwar Philosophy (1940), he made a first autobiographical attempt to publicly ascertain himself and determine his position. And in 1970 he published the concise retrospective A Giving of Accounts. The seminar will make these writings - which illuminate the significance of Nietzsche and Heidegger for Strauss and address his early engagement with revealed religion and politics, in a constellation ranging from Hermann Cohen and Franz Rosenzweig to Karl Barth and Carl Schmitt - the subject of a close reading.

In framing her 1818 novel as itself a monster with agency, she raises questions about why and how we continue to create and regard our creations as monstrous. Why has the creation of artificial life fascinated us from ancient times to modern A.I.? How do we recognize and identify monsters, and what role do we have in their creation? Are creators responsible for their creations, or alienated from them? This class combines close reading of Frankenstein with religious and scientific texts on monsters, the creation of artificial life, and our moral responsibilities to our creations. We will discuss what narratives about the monstrous tell us about our values, how the ""human"" is contrasted with its opposites, and why the story of Frankenstein-as well as its predecessors and imitators-remains so hauntingly compelling.",,"HIPS 27107, RLST 27107",,

His omnipresence in culture qualifies his tale as a ""modern myth."" Unquestionably, the most ambitious and significant rendering of the Faust myth is achieved in Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's two-part drama: Faust, the genesis of which extends across Goethe's entire creative life. This seminar is devoted to that work. We will study the entirety of Faust I and selected parts of Faust II. The aim of the seminar is to provide sound knowledge of a literary masterpiece that is deeply relevant to our present historical moment. Our primary focus will be on understanding the structure and meaning of the work with respect to this question: What is the vision of modernity (that is, our world) that comes to the fore in Goethe's tragedy?

Reading the colonial archive while thinking about contemporary Indigenous perspectives can help us bridge the past to the present and discuss issues concerning the underrepresentation of Indigenous women in the archive, language politics, communal identities, and Indigenous epistemologies while being particularly attentive to the rhetorical strategies deployed by colonial texts. Along the way, we will have in perspective how contemporary indigenous women resist, negotiate, and denounce the state, corporate, and patriarchal establishments. In this course, students will engage with primary sources of the colonial period in Latin America as they engage in debates surrounding gender and race in our present moment.

Readings are mostly from works of literature, including Dante's and Michelangelo's poems, Machiavelli's plays, and Elena Ferrante's most famous novel, but also critical texts by Freud, Barthes, and Butler. We will examine how literature and art reflect and challenge ideas about gender roles, bodily ideals and sexualization, misogyny, marriage, and polyamory. Additionally, we will explore portrayals of religious, ethno-geographic, and gender ""Others"" in texts by Jewish writer Sarra Copia Sulam, and highlight the pioneering contributions of women to science, focusing on Caterina Sforza, Isabella Cortese, and Margherita Sarrocchi, who advanced experimental practices in medicine, alchemy, and cosmetics.

GNSE 12130,Is Religion Bad for Women? 100 Units.,"Some scholars working in the study of gender and sexuality view religion as the conservative enemy of progress, irreconcilably antagonistic to the flourishing of any non-normative gender or sexuality. At the same time, some religious practitioners view feminism as a Western or liberal invention, an imposition that attempts to manage the lives of religious subjects. Still others find feminism and religious commitment mutually reinforcing, and have developed feminist, womanist, and queer rituals and theologies. This course examines contemporary texts, ethnographies, memoirs, and films that grapple with these tensions. In so doing, the course also helps students develop familiarity with foundational categories both in religious studies and in the study of gender and sexuality. Further questions to be explored include: Does religion facilitate or oppose the flourishing of women, queers, and people of color? Is religion a guardian of tradition that resists politically progressive aims, or do religions offer resources for interrogating secular liberalism?

Doubling as an introduction to medical sociology, this course considers medicine as an institution that produces knowledge, regulates bodies, shapes identities, and distributes access to health resources in ways that are uneven across, and significant for, categories of gender, sexuality, and other forms of social difference. We analyze these functions of medicine through some of its most prominent intersections with gender and sexuality in the United States, including the medicalization of homosexuality and gender variance, the medical regulation of reproduction from forced sterilizations to the rise of hospital births, the feminist health movement, intersex and gender-affirming medical practices, and the role of gender and sexual difference in medical research.

We will read poetry, essays, travelogues, and analyze the context within which a given literary work is entangled. Drawing on theories from cultural, gender, and critical race studies, this course reveals how early modern texts, art, intellectual debates, and politics shaped notions on gender, cultural identity, and racial categories, and why these ideas intertwine with concepts of ""place"" and ""space.""

GNSE 12162,"Queer Singing, Queer Spaces. 100 Units.","Queer practice and identity have long been expressed through/as song. According to Ovid, it was the great singer Orpheus who first introduced same-sex relationships to the people of Thrace; in early modern Europe, men performing the role of Orpheus on the operatic stage were often eunuchs with non-normative bodies singing in a vocal range traditionally associated with the feminine. Beyond fabled musicians, though, carnal technologies of the voice have continually been implicated in historically and geographically situated paradigms of queerness. Likewise, many of the spaces in which queer peoples have found community or refuge have been associated with music or singing. What might it suggest that in the twentieth century, generations of queer communities formed around listening to and ventriloquizing the voices of Judy Garland, Maria Callas, and Madonna? How might exclusively queer spaces, like the hijra communities of the Indian subcontinent, effect the production of voice and performance of music for its inhabitants and outside observers? For which audiences are young trans* people on YouTube documenting their vocal progressions over the course of their transitions? Why have both European and Chinese operatic traditions abounded with cross-dressing for most of their histories? In this course we will investigate the broad relationship between practices of the voice and the body and consider why so many of our cultural understandings of queerness are accompanied by singing.",,MUSI 22620,,Devon Borowski

In particular, we will ask how the very categories of sex and gender not only produce social meaning from bodies and their anatomical differences but may also be complicit in acts violence, oppression, and colonization. Thematically we will pay attention to the emergence and critique of the distinction between sex and gender; resistances to the gender binary; the relationship between gender, power, and authority; feminism and critiques of Western feminism; the category of woman as an object of scientific knowledge; and the flourishing of and violence against trans life. Finally, while we will be dealing with historical accounts in this course, the aim is to understand how the regulation of bodies in the past has informed and may challenge our understanding of the diversity of embodied experience in the present.",Autumn,,,Staff
GNSE 15003,Gender and Sexuality in World Civilizations II. 100 Units.,"The second half of the civ sequence will extend our earlier interrogation of bodies, sex, and gender into an examination of sexualities and socialities. Through an encounter with theoretical texts, literature, and art, we will investigate a series of important critiques of biopower, or statist strategies for regulating bodies and controlling populations. These interventions include critiques of nationalism, colonialism, capitalism, and heteronormativity, all of which, as we will see, contribute to our understanding of sexuality. Throughout the course, feminist and queer critique will fundamentally frame our analyses of power, desire, and sexuality. PQ: GNSE 15002.",Winter,,GNSE 15002,Staff
GNSE 16004,Jewish Civilization III - Mothers and Motherhood in Modern Jewish Culture. 100 Units.,"Jewish Civilization is a three-quarter sequence that explores the development of Jewish culture and tradition from its ancient beginnings through its rabbinic and medieval transformations to its modern manifestations. Through investigation of primary texts-biblical, Talmudic, philosophical, mystical, historical, documentary, and literary-students will acquire a broad overview of Jews, Judaism, and Jewishness while reflecting in greater depth on major themes, ideas, and events in Jewish history. This Jewish Civilization III course will focus on mothers and motherhood in modern Jewish culture. From sentimentalized keepers of Jewish tradition to objects of ridicule burdened by stereotypes of overbearing, guilt-inducing behavior, Jewish mothers hold a prominent role in Jewish self-representations. Writing alongside or against these stereotypes, Jewish mothers themselves have struggled with the obligations and expectations of Jewish motherhood. Engaging with a variety of literary, theological, historical, and pop culture texts, this class explores Jewish feminisms in relation to motherhood, Jewish fictions of motherhood, and the role of motherhood in Jewish religious life and thought. This course includes material from a variety of different contexts for modern Jewish life, but places particular emphasis on American Jewish history and culture.",Spring.

GNSE 20007,Africa in the Middle East and the Middle East in Africa. 100 Units.,"From Mansa Musa's Hajj in 1324 to the contemporary Afrobeats scene in Dubai, African and Middle Eastern societies share long histories of interconnection. This course examines these interconnections from the early modern to the contemporary era through a series of case studies ranging from traditions of exchange on the Swahili Coast, to the Ottoman Scramble for Africa, to the creation of a long-standing Lebanese diaspora in West Africa and a more recent Ethiopian Jewish community in Israel. Students will examine debates that animate this field of scholarship including conversations about race; histories of slavery and its legacies; conceptions of indigeneity, nativism, and settler colonialism; religious encounters; gender and society; shared and divergent experiences of European colonialism and struggles for independence; and transnational collective-building projects such as Pan-Africanism and Pan-Arabism. In addition to scholarship based on textual analysis, students will develop skills to investigate cultural sources such as music, photography, film, fashion, literature, and sports. No prior coursework in Middle Eastern or African studies is required. However, a background in African Civ, Islamic History and Society Civ, or Islamic Thought and Literature Civ is recommended.",Spring,"HIST 20007, RDIN 20007",,K. Hickerson
GNSE 20112,From the Harem to Helem: Gender and Sexuality in the Modern Middle East. 100 Units.,"This course will provide a historical and theoretical survey of issues pertaining to gender and sexuality in the modern Middle East. First, we will outline the colonial legacies of gender politics and gendered discourses in modern Middle Eastern history. We will discuss orientalist constructions of the harem and the veil (Allouche, Laila Ahmed, Lila Abu-Loghod), and their contested afterlives across the Middle East. We will also explore colonial (homo)sexuality, and attendant critiques (Najmabadi, Massad). We will pay especial attention to local discourses about gender and sexuality, and trouble facile assumptions of ""writing back"" while attending to the various specificities of local discourses of everyday life across various sites of the Middle East. Eschewing reductive traps for more nuanced explorations of the specifics of life in Beirut, Cairo, Istanbul, or Tehran - as well as to rural areas - we will show how gender and sexuality are constructed and practiced in these locales. In addition to foundational scholarly texts in the field, we will also engage with an array of cultural texts (films, novels, poetry, comics) and - where possible - have conversations with activists who are working in these sites via Skype/teleconferencing.",Spring,"NEHC 20034, NEHC 30034, GNSE 30112",,Stephanie Kraver
GNSE 20124,Fictions of Patriarchy in German Literature and Thought. 100 Units.,"In his 1861 study Mother Right, J. J. Bachofen argues that patriarchy is, at is most basic level, fictive. While the mother's connection to the child is materially perceptible-she gestates, births, and nurses her offspring-the father is a ""remoter potency"" whose relationship to his progeny, because it is always mediated through the mother, can never be known for sure. Paternity, Bachofen suggests, is a juridical invention rather than a naturally evident fact. Taking its cue from Bachofen, this course will investigate the relationship between notions of patriarchy and fictionality in German literature and thought. We will consider how philosophical texts use the figure of the father to ground their speculative claims, how literary narratives adapt changing ideas about the family and the state, and how concepts of patriarchy have structured thinking about fiction's function and effects. Readings from: Herder, Schiller, Fichte, Kleist, Bachofen, Hauptmann, Freud, Werfel, Heiner Müller, and Jelinek, among others.",Spring,"GRMN 33823, GNSE 30124, GRMN 23823",,Sophie Salvo

Students will explore these areas through engaging with historical and contemporary narratives, research, and popular media, heavily drawing in a U.S. context, but not exclusively. Through an engagement of Black women in the U.S. labor force, this course will explore three questions. How has the labor of Black women contributed to the sustainability of communities, families, and institutions? What are the choices Black women make to engage and sustain their work? What is the future of the labor of Black women? Is the future one that is liberatory or not? Students will leave this course with an understanding of the ways intersectional experiences of oppression contribute to complex conditions and decision-making, that shape the labor of Black women, the function of certain labor decisions as sites of resistance, as well as the generative resources that support the professional success and well-being of Black women.",TBD,"SSAD 29600, SSAD 69600, RDIN 26600",,
GNSE 20129,Writing Gender. 100 Units.,"In German, even if you are not writing about gender, you are always writing gender: the grammatical categories ""masculine,"" ""feminine,"" and ""neuter"" are implicated in every noun declension and personal pronoun. How have writers negotiated this in their constructions of gender identity? In this course, we will examine how gender has been thought within and beyond the masculine/feminine binary in German intellectual history. We will study historical conceptions of grammatical gender as well as recent attempts to make German more inclusive for genderfluid and trans people (e.g., neopronouns). Finally, we will consider how authors use literature as a space for gender exploration, such as in Kim de L'Horizon's recent award-winning novel Blutbuch.

The lavish cinematic spectacle of Taylor Swift's ""Bad Blood"" and the fanbait intertextuality of SM Entertainment's Aespa. Since MTV's advent in 1981, hit music videos have made a number of pop songs inextricable from iconic imagery and choreography; ubiquitous digital devices and the rise of platforms like YouTube and TikTok have only increased pop music's audiovisuality. Looking at and listening to female pop icons raises fraught questions of agency, representation, race, sexuality/sexualization, bodies, commodification, and capital. In this course, students will gain a vocabulary for talking about both the audio and visual parameters of music video, and they will use this vocabulary to engage with critical frameworks for examining meaning, circulation, and reception in contemporary music videos. Assignments across the course will allow students to experiment with a range of writing and media genres, including critical close readings, micro-reception histories, thinkpieces, podcast episodes, and video essays.",Autumn,"MUSI 27423, MADD 14723",,Paula Harper
GNSE 20139,"Midwives, Healers, and ""Abortionists"" 100 Units.","In the 19th and early 20th centuries in the US, most births moved from the home (where they were often attended by midwives) to the hospital (where they were almost always attended by male doctors). In recent decades, demand for midwives has reemerged across the political spectrum. Some see midwives as a bulwark against contracting reproductive rights and autonomy; some see them as protection from government overreach and regulation, or as a return to a lost traditional or religious past; many see them as an answer to a medical system that has failed to meet the needs of mothers and babies. This course will follow the history of midwives, women healers, and abortion providers from antiquity through the Middle Ages and to the present, with a focus on the political, legal, and religious context of midwifery in twentieth and twenty-first century US. Topics include witchcraft accusations of midwives and healers; the importance of Black midwives in the antebellum south; the role of race and gender in laws against practicing midwifery; convergences and divergences between the natural birth movement and the reproductive rights movement; and the prevalence of homebirth among Christian momfluencers.",Winter,"HLTH 27808, HIST 27808",,P.

This course will explore how Indian authors of the late 19th and early 20th centuries engaged with the so-called ""women's question."" Caught between middle-class conservatism and the urge for social reform, Hindi and Urdu writers addressed controversial issues such as female education, child marriage, widow remarriage, and prostitution in their fictional and discursive writings. We will explore the tensions of a literary and social agenda that advocated the 'uplift' of women as a necessary precondition for the progress of the nation, while also expressing patriarchal fears about women's rights and freedom. The course is open to both undergraduate and graduate students. Basic knowledge of Hindi and/or Urdu is preferable, but not required. We will read works by Nazir Ahmad, Premcand, Jainendra Kumar, Mirza Hadi Ruswa, and Mahadevi Varma in English translation, and also look at texts used in Indian female education at the time.",TBD,"GNSE 47900, SALC 27904, SALC 43800",Consent of instructor based on demonstrated knowledge of Hindi,Ulrike Stark

GNSE 20153,Practicum: Women and Society. 100 Units.,"Although the inequities between men and women have diminished during the last decades, large gaps are still evident and resistant to change. Throughout this course, we will explore the origins of these disparities which are all fundamentally rooted in the patriarchal nature of society. Understanding how patriarchy came to be the dominant order requires a multidisciplinary and historical approach. The first lectures will cover debates in biology, human evolution, history and archeology that explain the deep roots and the spread of this order throughout the centuries. The next set of lectures will cover how current cultural practices and social norms facilitate the reproduction of the patriarchy and will also examine alternative ways in which societies have organized themselves where women have powerful roles or live in matriarchies. The class will also capture how women from the Global South contest this order within their societies and on their own terms. Finally, we will evaluate policies that have aimed to close the gap between men and women around the world. A central theme of the course is that to understand how to craft effective policies one needs to understand the mechanisms which created patriarchy and led it to persist. The students will offer presentations that will revise these policies from a critical perspective based on the material we covered throughout the quarter. The final lectures will include a variety of guest speakers.",,"LACS 28498, PBPL 28498",,
GNSE 21400,Advanced Theories of Gender and Sexuality. 100 Units.,"Beginning with the fraught legacy of the New Left and the proliferation of ""new social movements"" such as feminism and gay liberation, this seminar explores the key debates around which gender and sexuality were articulated as tenacious but open structures of power subject to political critique and social transformation. The relatively stable yet dynamic character of what Gayle Rubin in 1975 famously called ""the sex/gender system"" raises basic questions of structure and event: (1) how are systemic relations of domination and rule historically constituted and sustained over time?; and (2) how can that which is regularly reproduced be not only momentarily interrupted, but fundamentally altered through both quotidian and extraordinary forms of action and worlding? The unexpected character of the new social movements called for a radical rethinking of structures and their transformation. Haunted by unpredictable forms of resistance, heteropatriarchal structures challenged theorists and activists to forge new frameworks of critique that refigured basic concepts of power, subjectivity, and agency. These frameworks are examined with an eye to how racialized sexuality and gender are created and contested in the context of modern biopolitical capitalism and its constitution of naturalized conceptions of rule.",Autumn,"CCCT 31400, PLSC 31410, PLSC 21410, CCCT 21400, GNSE 31400",,Linda Zerilli

GNSE 22000,Introduction to Black Studies. 100 Units.,"This course introduces students to the study of Blackness from multiple perspectives: racial, political, cultural, and intellectual. We will adopt a global perspective to our study that highlights differential histories and experiences of Black people in various areas of the world. Attentive to the origin of the discipline in political struggle, we will constantly question the ties of Black studies scholarship to the communities whose struggle it is founded on. With a consideration of the adjacent histories of racialization and other forms of oppression, this course invites students to consider the relation between Blackness and other social categories such as gender and class. We will ask questions such as: What are the methods and approaches to the study of Blackness? How has the history of African and African diasporic people shaped the contemporary world? How can we build a world founded on freedom for all? Assigned materials include academic texts, fiction, and other media such as film & music. Select topics include the histories of enslavement and colonization, revolution, Black feminism, and Afrofuturism. Students will work on weekly reflections, a mid-term paper and a final team project. For the sake of a collaborative pedagogy anchored in the work of social movements, students are encouraged to imagine together the best form this course can take and to enact course practices and changes that keep us all true to the radical vocation of Black Studies as a discipline.",Winter,RDIN 22000,,Kevin Irakoze

We will ask: How does actual theatrical practice shape the way that identity was understood in this period? What components of identity, particularly in terms of race, class, gender, and sexuality, are privileged or destabilized by the eighteenth-century stage? Course reading will focus primarily on Restoration and eighteenth-century British drama, but may also include short works of eighteenth-century fiction and philosophy, as well as selected secondary readings in theatre history, performance studies, and gender and sexuality studies. The final syllabus will be shaped by what's on in London in the fall; we will hopefully be able to attend a performance or two, and consider how recent playwrights look back to the eighteenth century in their own work.

It references the legacies of earlier identity constructions in the creation of these categories, as well as analyzing its transnational and trans-imperial dimensions. The class combines intellectual, cultural, and social history to illuminate the actors, encounters, and debates animating this dynamic field of study-moving beyond assumptions of African societies as spaces of ethnic-and not racialized-identities to examine the construction of difference through transnational history of science, gender and sexuality studies, histories of slavery, Middle Eastern colonial projects, as well as the invention of the category of ""native"" in European colonial discourse. Are categories of differences primarily due to European colonialism, as many claim? Or are they embedded in a more complex configuration coming from settler colonial projects, national liberation struggles, and postcolonial nativist discourses? Students examine case studies from across the continent-from Ghana to Sudan to South Africa-paying close attention to experiences of Asian, Arab, and mixed-race peoples navigating colonial and postcolonial African states; while keeping an eye on how debates about difference, diaspora, and nationalism in North America and Europe inform discussions of race in Africa, and how Africans shape discourses of race in colonial metropoles and the United States.",Winter,"HIST 20205, HIPS 20205, RDIN 20205",,K.

We will use the life and music of Morrissey, the controversial former frontman of The Smiths, as a lens through which to explore our country's most critical social issues. An outspoken defender of animal rights and disaffected youth's preeminent lyricist, Morrissey has also increasingly flirted with nationalist policies. As such, he embodies the tensions, complexities, and ambiguities around critical topics that characterize our time. Guided by sociological theory, we will examine the latest social science evidence on race, immigration, gender and sexuality, health, poverty, segregation, crime, and education as they are key sites in which social inequality is produced and reproduced today.

Could individuals challenge, or even transgress, the societal-and, therefore, gendered-norms by which they were bound? How were the ideals of femininity and masculinity constructed in artistic and literary production? To what extent were gender and sexuality fixed or fluid in the early modern imaginary? These are but a few of the questions that will be addressed in this course, as we examine the complexities and nuances of gender and sexuality in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Spanish culture. We will engage primarily with literary sources, such as poetry, narrative, theatrical works, and autobiographical writings from key literary figures (Garcilaso de la Vega, Teresa de Ávila, María de Zayas, Lope de Vega, to name a few). Moreover, we will examine visual art as well as medical and moral treatises in order to gain as comprehensive as possible an understanding of the notion of gender and sexuality during this time period.

Organized thematically and covering a region that spans from North Africa to Iran, we will use the analytics of race and gender in an intersecting way to explore topics in the Middle East such as: structural racism, colonialism, slavery, local nationalisms, whiteness, racism in nation building, eugenics, scientific racism, and global solidarity movements. In so doing, our course will reveal that race is an operative category in the study of Middle East history, the historical racial logics operating in various Middle Eastern countries, and how race and gender intersect at the site of individual as well as the effects of this. This course is designed for anyone interested in race theory, gender theory, intersectionality, and Middle East history. By the end of this course, students will have the tools to think in a multidimensional way about aspects of Middle East history that do not often receive such an intersectional treatment. Additionally, they will develop the methodological tools to discern local race and gender logics that might be different than what they're most familiar with. Finally, through coming to understand their relationship to the knowledge of our course, students will also be able to use the course as a springboard for continued learning in other courses that treat race, gender, and the Middle East.",Autumn,"CRES 12500, NEHC 22500",,Chelsie May

Through a varied catalog of disciplinary frameworks, e.g., history, theology, medical ethics, sociology of religion, and history of medicine, students will weigh the accuracy of Lofton's claim that for Americans, AIDS is more than just a disease. Thus, we will scrutinize moral rhetoric surrounding contraception and its public availability. We will discuss the extent to which religious philanthropy, especially on the international stage, reshaped approaches to global health.

To make things even more complicated, religion is also an object of the law-the law tries to adjudicate the rights of religious Americans under a system of religious freedom, with varying degrees of success. Often, the tension between law and religion comes to a head on issues of sex. The collision of religion, sex, and law presents a whole host of problems and questions: How have religion and law historically related to each other when it comes to sex? How has religion shaped the law on issues of sex, and vice versa? What is, or should be, the role of the law in adjudicating issues of sexual morality and religion? In this class, we will begin with the question: how do religion and law shape our lives? Through attention to issues of sex and gender, we will explore what it means to live within the institutions of law and religion and how those institutions interrelate.

We will examine the lineage, history, and practice of this genre, with a special emphasis on feminist playwrights and performers, such as Typhaine D, Jalila Baccar, Fanny Cabon, and Florence Foresti. We will study the underlying components of solo performances and learn how to integrate them into different modes, including storytelling, one-woman or one-man shows, and standup. The selected plays will illustrate how the art of the solo voice can empower under-represented communities and minorities to share powerful narratives and create a new space for visibility and listening. The class will combine history, practice, and creative writing, and will afford students the opportunity to apply this knowledge in a series of live performances that will allow them to creatively connect to the issues raised in the readings and draw from their own experiences, inspirations, and questions. Students will develop creative and critical tools to fully explore the solo voice as a form of artistic expression, honing their talents in writing, devising, composing, producing, and creating work. Performance recordings will be obtained and shared with the class to further enhance the learning experience. One of the unique opportunities of this course is the opportunity to work with texts obtained directly from the playwrights.",Course not offered in 24-25.,"FREN 24724, TAPS 20235",Reading knowledge of French.,Khouloud Gargouri

These women are portrayed as fascinating yet threatening figures. This ancient imagery has permeated contemporary literature, manifested in novels that depict women who remove themselves from ""civilization"" to inhabit rural areas of Catalunya, seeking freedom and having to confront at the same time societal norms, abusive partners or even their own personal demons. The mountains, far from ideal and peaceful, are an untamed and often brutal space in which human lives hold no greater value than those of goats, mushrooms, rivers. In this course we shall engage with four novels authored by women: ""Solitude (1904) by Victor Català, ""Stone in a Landslide"" (1984) by Maria Barbal, ""When I Sing Mountains Dance"" (2019) by Irene Solà, and ""Alone"" (2021) by Carlota Gurt.

Latin American activists, performers, writers, and filmmakers have attempted to reckon with the impacts of femicide in the cultural sphere, seeking to not only identify the social, historical, and political roots of gender violence, but also advocate for justice and mourn those they have lost. This course will discuss prevailing discourses of femicide in the region, addressing the roles of activism, journalism, literature, and film in both shaping and responding to these discourses. Texts will include memoirs like Cristina Rivera Garza's El invencible verano de Liliana (2021), documentaries like Lourdes Portillo's Señorita extraviada (2001), as well as fiction, such as Roberto Bolaño's ""La parte de los crímenes"" from the novel 2666 (2004).",Spring,"SPAN 27025, LACS 27025",SPAN 20300 or consent of instructor.,Laura Colaneri

The centrality of sex and sexuality in human life makes it an apt, albeit complex object of philosophical inquiry. And, whereas many thinkers advance that our sexual lives hold a major influence on most other domains on our existence, we spend little time with intellectual inquiry about sex. In this course, we will engage with some classic texts alongside some of the most exciting recent writings in the philosophy of sex. We will explore such themes and topics as the erotic, sexual desire, perversion, consent, sexual orientation, pornography, prostitution, and sex equality. We will explore these themes through various perspectives, including metaphysics, ethics, and politics.

GNSE 23178,The Queer Enemy and the Politics of Homophobia. 100 Units.,"How is the queer enemy politically constructed? And what are the uses and effects of this enemy in contemporary politics? This course investigates queer sexuality as a specific kind of threat and homophobia as a specific mode of political antagonism. Key to understanding this specificity is the examination of other kinds of political enemies. Across categories of gender, sexuality, race, religion, and empire, the course theorizes the queer enemy in a comparative perspective. Engaging scholars like Monique Wittig, Simone de Beauvoir, Frantz Fanon, and Jean Paul Sartre, we compare homophobia with other forms of political enmity like misogyny, anti-Black racism, and anti-Semitism. After investigating antagonism across categories of political difference, we delve into the specificities of homophobic antagonism in the second half of the course. Here, we explore how the queer threat is framed: through metaphors of civilizational destruction but also through anti-sodomy and anti-disclosure laws. We also trace how the normalization of the queer enemy has produced new enemies. Through notions of ""Pinkwashing"" and the ""Gay International,"" we further examine how queer liberation is made to stand in for colonial domination. But we also read critiques of the ""gay=colonialism"" equation, asking how homophobia mediates anti-colonial politics. Finally, we conclude the course with Michel Foucault's seminal essay and relate the question of the queer enemy to the threat of new human relations.",Winter,"HMRT 23178, PLSC 23178, RDIN 23178",,Omar Safadi

The course is divided into two sections. First, we begin by considering what makes a critical approach critical-that is, how is it set apart from conventional approaches? In particular, we will explore how critical approaches encourage us to question our assumptions, first, about what security, power, sovereignty, and other core concepts mean in global politics, and second, about who or what (individuals, groups, nonhuman animals, states, the planet) can be agents of global politics. Some examples of approaches we cover are: theories from the Global South, approaches to human security, global feminisms, securitization theories, ontological security, emotions and affect, the visual turn, new materialisms, and post-colonial perspectives.

This no-prior-knowledge-necessary course explores the complex, sometimes fraught, relationship between religion and human rights from World War II to the present. We will begin by juxtaposing the role religious ideas played in the drafting of core post-war human rights documents (e.g. the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, etc.) with the decision by drafters to omit direct references to the divine or the beliefs of specific religious communities. Using case study analysis and close reading of primary religious texts, scholarly commentary, and historical accounts, we will examine the ways in which individuals and groups from multiple religious (and non-religious) traditions both apply and push back against existing human rights norms. Throughout the course we will discuss the role religion might play in debates surrounding emerging, but still contentious, conceptions of human rights.

Where opera is commonly associated with extravagant performance and production, cinema is popularly associated realism. Yet their encounter not only proves these assumptions wrong but produces some extraordinary third kinds-media hybrids. It also produces some extraordinary love affairs. Thomas Edison wanted a film of his to be ""a grand opera,"" and Federico Fellini and Woody Allen wanted opera to saturate their films. Thinking about these mutual attractions, ""Opera across Media"" explores different operatic and cinematic repertories as well as other media forms. Among films to be studied are Pabst's Threepenny Opera (1931), Visconti's Senso (1954), Powell and Pressburger's Tales of Hoffmann (1951), Zeffirelli's La traviata (1981), De Mille's Carmen (1915), Losey's Don Giovanni (1979), Bergman's The Magic Flute (1975), and Fellini's E la nave va (1983). No prior background in music performance, theory, or notation is needed. Students may write papers based on their own skills and interests relevant to the course.

We will furthermore look at how this space was transformed in the era of European expansionism and colonial rule in the subcontinent, becoming a flash point over questions of social reform and Indian nationalism. Materials will include not just secondary literature but also excerpts from contemporary historical accounts, paintings, short stories, photographs, and films.

In the first weeks of the course, as we think about bodies in the virtual space, we will be asking questions related to embodiment and representation: how does the process of avatar creation reinforce or dismantle assumptions about gender readability and performance? How do immersive experiences induce feelings of gender euphoria and dysphoria? The following weeks we will explore and discuss the way VR experiences can engage with the concept of physical borders-calling their existence into questions in some cases, making them particularly salient in others. We will discuss virtual travel, digital border-crossing, and explore art installations that reflect on migration experiences. The final weeks will build on our previous conversations, and together we will reflect on the fluid meaning of space in a virtual setting and on the creative possibilities that such fluidity entails: What does it mean to reimagine space beyond physical limitations? How do we understand the political salience of taking up space in digitally built social environments? The course combines readings and theoretical conversations with hands-on experiences in VR and explorations of virtual worlds. Previous experience with VR is not required.

We will pay special attention to how such an identity is expressed through and informed by religious experience, and to how religious experience is theoretically articulated in Latinx theology and religious thought. To pursue this task, we will devote the first part of the class to the examination of the conditions of possibility of latinidad by focusing on the formation of the Latinx self. What makes Latines, Latines? Is this a forcefully assigned identity or one that can be claimed and embraced with pride? Is there such a thing as a unified Latinx self or shall we favor approaches that stress hybridity or multiplicity? In the second part of the class, we will shift from self-formation to community-formation by examining the experience of mestizaje (racial mixing) and its theoretical articulation in Latinx theology. Is this concept useful to describe the Latinx experience or does it romanticize the violence of European colonialism? Lastly, we will return to the formation of Latinx identity considering the ambiguities of religious ethnic identity through the examples of tensions between Catholic and Evangelical Latinos, and those emerging from the experiences of Latinos converting to non-Christian religions.

How do these Christians imagine the role of the church in secular democratic space? What is the nature of their religious lives? Under what mandates do they operate? What scriptures do they read?

Does Judaism teach a distinct approach to the body, illness, and healing? And more significantly, why should religion have anything to do with one's health today? In this course we will grapple with our assumptions regarding modern Western medicine by discussing topics in Jewish medical thought and ethics. We will study how Judaism - its texts, history, laws, and traditions - intersect with issues of science, medicine, and the body. In particular we will think about how a Jewish approach to medicine, and more broadly a religious approach, might complicate contemporary assumptions about the body and healing. We will also consider how Jewish bodies have been imagined and stereotyped, and think about how that might affect Jewish approaches to disease and medical ethics. This course will thus offer students a way to think about alternatives to assumptions about medicine, the body, and ethics in the secular West, which will be explored both in class materials and in personal projects.

Significant attention will also be given to the narrative poetics of the post-ETA period, during which works by female authors have played a leading role in examining the gender policies that have governed the so-called Basque conflict. The link established between the female figure and the transmission of a ""dangerous"" memory must be interpreted in the light of the current historical moment characterized by the struggle for the telling of the past and the interrogation of gender.

Whether articulating personal taste or reflecting a collective identity, dress can be a powerful symbol-both historically and in the contemporary world. Worn against the skin, clothing is both intimate and connects us to a global, multi-billion-dollar system that employs roughly one in every ten people worldwide. This course addresses the multivalent history of dress from early modern imperial encounters in the Atlantic World, to anti-colonial movements in South Asia, to the nineteen-forties American Zoot Suit Riots-demonstrating the ways that clothes are connected to gendered and racial categories, political projects, and the shape of global capitalism. Students will analyze case studies from Malabar to Manchester, colonial Lima to revolutionary France, nineteenth-century Zanzibar to nineteen-eighties New York. Examining the history of dress and its global interconnections necessitates an interdisciplinary approach; therefore, students will combine historical scholarship with theoretical frameworks from the anthropology of dress and methodologies from material culture studies to analyze sources ranging from museum objects to films, haute couture fashion to flip-flops.

We will consider multiple angles for approaching the study of mathematics by connecting mathematical knowledge to topics such as labor, racial sciences, pedagogy, material tools, masculinity, nation-building, and embodiment. This will allow us to move beyond simply considering representation (of women in STEM, for example) to think about how gender and race are part of the construction of mathematical knowledge.

GEOS 26100,Phylogenetics and the Fossil Record. 100 Units.,"Phylogenies are branching diagrams that reflect evolutionary relationships. In addition to providing information on the history of life, phylogenies are fundamental to modern methods for studying macroevolutionary and macroecological pattern and process. In the biological sciences, phylogenies are most often inferred from genetic data. In paleobiology, phylogenies can only be inferred from the fossilized remains of morphological structures, and collecting and analyzing morphological data present a different set of challenges. In this course, students will study both traditional and state-of-the-art approaches to inferring phylogenies in the fossil record, from data collection to interpretation. Lectures will explore the statistical underpinnings of phylogenetic methods, as well as their practical implementation in commonly used software.

Marx, Nietzsche, Freud It would be hard to overestimate the influence which Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Sigmund Freud have exercised over intellectual modernity. Perhaps no other three figures have cast such a long shadow. For better or worse, they've left significant traces which persist in concepts like class struggle or ideology, nihilism or value-judgments, and subconscious complexes or repression, as well as infamously critical views of religion. Paul Ricœur once grouped them under the label of ""masters of suspicion"", referring to a method of interpretation which searches for deeper, hidden meanings and regards the rest as mere illusions. But why should they be grouped together as such a trio or unholy alliance, as they so often are? What, if anything, do they really have in common? Why are their ideas so controversial and contested? And why might they continue to have such lasting power?

GRMN 23683,What is Nature? - 20th-Century Continental Philosophy. 100 Units.,"In this course, we follow the topic of the meaning of nature in philosophy, beginning our exploration right around the point when explicit discussion of nature becomes less prominent. We intend to develop a coherent narrative about major philosophical developments from Nietzsche through Derrida through the lens offered by this question, examining existentialism, phenomenology, and deconstruction along the way. Students should come away from this course with a grounded sense of what each term means, resulting in foundational knowledge of Continental philosophy after Nietzsche. We will take an interdisciplinary approach, as the question of nature often emerges for our authors in engagement with art, whether drama, poetry, or painting, all of which will be addressed. This course's starting point for our reflections on nature is Nietzsche's notion of the death of God, a theme to which we will return with all three of our main authors, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Derrida. Recurrent themes will be: nature and eros, nature and human finitude, the human being as (un)natural, and the very viability of the concept of nature. Additional authors include Aristotle, Plato, Sappho, Sophocles, Friedrich Hölderlin, Leo Strauss, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Judith Butler, and discuss paintings by Paul Cézanne and Vincent van Gogh. An interesting question to pose along the way will be the relationship (or lack thereof) between the views of nature on offer to our ecological concerns today.",Winter.

GRMN 23835,"Writing the Sea: Politics, Environment, History. 100 Units.","In this course, we will embark on a journey through German cultural history from the point of view of the sea. We will engage with what recent Blue Humanities scholarship has termed ""maritime world pictures"" and the ""poetic history of the ocean"" (Søren Frank). Our discussions will focus on the political significance of imagined and real maritime spaces. The sea will emerge as a site of intersecting themes in modern social and natural life-including natural beauty and catastrophe, global trade and colonial subjugation, adventure and law, environmental habitats and media representation. We will examine how humans demarcate their habitats from aquatic worlds, imagine open waters as threatening or sociable spaces, and develop new ways of representing the sea in eras of nautical industrialization and environmental crisis. Our journey will encompass a broad range of cultural artifacts from the seventeenth century to the present, such as translations of scripture, canonical narratives of natural disaster, pirate stories, legal texts, paintings, video art, and documentaries. Readings and discussions will be conducted in German.",Winter,,,Peter Metzel
GRMN 24425,Metropolis Berlin. 100 Units.,"Berlin, with its fractured histories, has been a crucible for artists, poets, filmmakers, and cultural critics to engage with thinking about the city. The period of the Weimar Republic (1918-1933) has often been described with the metaphor of ""dancing on the volcano."" What does this term, suggestive of freedom, experimentation, but also impending doom, mean? With Berlin's unprecedented expansion in the nineteenth- century and early twentieth centuries, distinctive new modes of perception and experience connected to the metropolis gave shape to experimental literary works. Cultural critics such as Georg Simmel and Walter Benjamin examined the impact of cities on the psyches and bodies of their inhabitants. And new media such as film captured the realities of urban life in stunning detail (as in Ruttmann's Symphony of a City), while painting attempted to depict the convulsive movements of the city.",Winter,,,Catriona MacLeod
GRMN 24810,Devotion-Dissent-Disenchantment: Art in the Age of the Reformation. 100 Units.,"In the years leading up to Martin Luther's radical transformation of the political-religious landscape, late medieval and early modern Europeans were inundated with a flood of ""alternative facts"" that called into question the intellectual, ethical, and religious values governing their lives. With the advent of new media technologies, images became important vehicles of commentary and disputation for Reformers, leading to the formation of a public sphere of discourse to which the image was central; yet, at the same time, the image itself and its role in daily life came increasingly under attack. This course provides an introduction to artistic production in northern Europe from the late fourteenth century through the sixteenth century through the lens of the productive, if tumultuous, relationship between art and the epistemological challenges of the Reformation. Particular attention will be paid to the shifting status of the artist, focusing on the historical and cultural circumstances that led to the elevation of artists such as Albrecht Dürer, Hans Baldung, and Pieter Bruegel the Elder, as well as their relationship to the world outside the Alps, including Italy, Spain, and the New World. This course will also examine topics such as the relationship between word and image, iconoclasm and iconophilia, public and private spheres of patronage, and strategies of visual polemics. Readings will include primary sources in translation and selected works of modern scholarship.",Spring,"RLST 28810, ARTH 14810",,T. Golan
GRMN 25120,"Nietzsche: Culture, Critique, Self-Transcendence. 100 Units.","This course is conceived as a pathway to the Humanities and an introduction to the work of Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900). A range of Nietzsche's work will be considered, but the focus will be on three themes to which Nietzsche recurred throughout his writing career: Culture: Nietzsche's thought on the anthropological roots and the expressive forms of human meaning-making: Apollo/Dionysus; Gesture; Music; Metaphor Critique: the vacuous character of modern culture; romanticism, decadence, nihilism. Self-Transcendence: individual self-realization and freedom. The selection of these themes is motivated by the fact that they may be considered as fundamental dimensions of humanistic inquiry. Students will develop a sound understanding of a writer whose intellectual influence continues to grow, but at the same time they will become acquainted with such core concepts of humanistic/interpretive inquiry as form, expression, ideology, genealogy, discourse, self-fashioning, individuality, and value.",Winter,"SIGN 26013, FNDL 25121",,David Wellbery
GRMN 25325,"Decadence, the fin de siècle, and the art of excess in literature and film. 100 Units.","Decadence was probably the most daring and most panned movement in European art and culture around 1900. Synonymous with hedonism, excess, transgression, eroticism, and cultural decline, decadent art and literature were often stigmatized as amoral and ""unhealthy."" Yet Decadence has continued to be a source of inspiration and fascination. Recent English language examples like the films of Yorgos Lanthimos and Sean Baker, or fiction by Ottessa Moshfegh and Hanya Yanagihara can be traced back to this movement and show the genre's endurance. This course seeks to introduce students to the most important decadent motifs, themes and characters via intense intellectual engagement with decadent literature, visual art and film. Readings will include both historical and more contemporary examples by Arthur Schnitzler, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ernst Jünger, Richard Strauss, R.W. Fassbinder, and Ulrike Ottinger among others.

GRMN 26425,Reading Marx's Capital: A Critique of Political Economy. 100 Units.,"Karl Marx's account of ""those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails"" remains one of the most influential yet contentious theories ever committed to paper. Often invoked in times of turmoil, his name has come to mean different things to different people. Yet it is not always clear in fact just what his theory is, doubtless in part because his writings are quite challenging to read. In this course, students will engage fundamentally with Marx's writings to gain a clear idea of his theory for themselves. We will do so by reading volume 1 of Marx's Capital as well as selections from volumes 2 and 3 and Theories of Surplus Value. We will approach Marx own his own terms, considering context and comparison with other highlights from the history of political economy only where they are relevant. Topics which we will address include Marx's view of ""alienation"", ""commodity fetishism"", and ""class struggle"", but also labor, employment, money, capital, profit, and crisis. We will be reading Paul Reiter's new translation of Capital: Critique of Political Economy, Volume 1 (Princeton 2024), which students must bring to every class. The course will be held in English and there are no prerequisites. But students should read Marx's short essay, ""Wage Labor and Capital"", to prepare in advance of our first meeting.",Autumn,"MAPS 31529, PHIL 26425, MAPH 36425, PLSC 26425, GRMN 36425, PHIL 36425",,Daniel Burnfin

GRMN 26725,Staging Richard Wagner's Ring of the Nibelung in the 21st Century. 100 Units.,"This team-taught course explores the challenges of staging Richard Wagner's sprawling 19th-century tetralogy The Ring of the Nibelung in the 21st century. The course will offer an introduction to The Ring, including its complicated place in history (including its reception and production history), and how it has been thought about in recent musicology and critical theory. But first and foremost, we will be exploring how the piece is being staged today. To that end, we will explore four productions of the tetralogy that are currently being prepared at leading opera houses around the world - in Munich, London, Berlin, and Oslo - speaking, via Zoom, with artistic directors and the production teams about their ideas and ambitions. What are the interpretive challenges and opportunities in staging this mammoth work? How do these productions seek to engage the tetralogy's exceedingly complicated aesthetic ambitions, political baggage, and production history? And how do specific geographical, cultural, and historical conditions affect the artistic project of each production? Our discussions will encompass a range of fields, approaches, and topics. Among the themes we plan to examine are the aspiration to aesthetic totalization, the politics of community, the relationship between canonicity and critique, the notion of distress or emergency (the German term is Not), and some astonishingly lurid fantasies of family life-mostly of family dissolution.

GRMN 27525,"Rilke, Malte, Modernism. 100 Units.","The concept of ""modernism"" embraces a number of artistic trends and movements that arose in the second half of the nineteenth century in Europe and continued well into the twentieth century. In this seminar we will examine works of literature and visual art that are understood as ""modernist"" and works of criticism and philosophical contributions devoted to understanding what modernism is. The work of Rainer Maria Rilke will be an important point of reference. We will study his novel The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge and selected poems and essays. Since Paris is the locus of (much of) Rilke's novel, we will look back to Baudelaire, especially his essay The Painter of Modern Life, and his poem À une passante (To a passerby) along with relevant commentaries. Rilke worked on the novel during a period when he was also engaged with Cezanne's painting, which affords an opportunity to consider certain paintings by Cézanne. Here we will be guided by Maurice Merleau-Ponty's essay Cezanne's Doubt, Robert Pippin's study After the Beautiful: Hegel and the Philosophy of Pictorial Modernism (2014), and T.J. Clark's recent book If these Apples Should Fall: Cézanne and the Present (2022). The course is a grad-level participatory (discussion-intensive) seminar.

GLST 20203,Caste and Race: The Politics of Radical Equality. 100 Units.,"This course will explore the bodies of knowledge surrounding the politics and practices of caste in South Asia. We will study the emergence and development of radical social movements in the colonial and postcolonial periods that were opposed to caste oppression, along with scholarship that seeks to understand how such a form of social hierarchy and difference operates within regional and national communities. We will also examine how caste interacts with forms of identity such as class, gender, and religion. Caste has often been compared to race: we will study historical parallels as well as present scholarship and activism that aligns political struggles against caste and racial injustice in South Asia and the United States. Through close readings of primary sources and secondary literature in the fields of history, political science, anthropology and literature, the course will foreground the ubiquity of caste in everyday life in South Asia; the epistemologies that have developed to explain, understand and accommodate it; and finally the urgent, radical struggles that seek to annihilate it.",Spring,"SOCI 20529, SALC 20203, GNSE 22233, KNOW 30203, SALC 30203, KNOW 20203, SOCI 30529, GNSE 32233",,Ahona Panda

This course seeks to expand this popular understanding of Jainism by posing a question: What does it mean to be a Jain in the world when the Jain religion is fundamentally otherworldly in its orientation? By reading ethnographies and historical studies alongside primary sources, this course will introduce students to Jainism as an enduring lived religion whose meaning and practices have changed over time, across regions, between sectarian communities, and in conversation with Buddhism and Hinduism. By the end of the quarter, students can expect to understand Jainism as a minor religion with a major impact.",Spring,"SALC 20910, RLST 20904",,Sarah Pierce Taylor

Health inequalities around the world are staggering, as is their toll on human suffering. What does a just response entail? What moves us to be just, and why do we so often fail? What do our failures of response tell us about the moral complexities involved, and importantly, about ourselves? In this course, we will consider these questions critically in terms of a basic problem of solidarity. Solidarity rests on our capacity for other-regard-for sympathy toward another-but how do we do that for distant others who are worlds apart? Is it possible, and what are the moral dangers of assuming that we can or cannot? We will test the importance of such questions for a just global health by examining some key theories of health justice, the insights of cultural and religious studies, and the question of what moves us to be just.",Spring,"RLST 26309, CCTS 21009, HIPS 21009, HLTH 21009",,Daniel T.

We will ask what these experiences have done to concepts and notions of the youth. In other words, if youth is a construct like gender and caste then how was it constructed over the last seventy odd years? What were the desires and anxieties of the larger society that have shaped very distinctive trajectories for the youth in India? How were young people fashioning themselves and carving out their own social spaces? As we progress through the quarter, we will keep two guiding questions in mind - who all are considered to be the youth in postcolonial India? And - what are the lived experiences of young people during this time? The ever changing, seemingly arbitrary, and conflicting definitions of youth in government reports, commercial advertisements, or popular culture demands a thorough analysis of this significant and impact-making category inside out.",Winter,"SALC 21352, HIST 26906, GNSE 31352, KNOW 21352, SALC 31352, GNSE 21352, SOCI 20533",,Titas De Sarkar

Since 2021, several educational institutions and corporations in the US have recognized caste as a protected category. Against this background, the course invites students to pay attention to caste as an emergent and recent form of discrimination in the US, and evaluate it against the oldest, race. The course will provide students with an overview of the major intellectual trajectories of the two movements and identify notable moments of synchronicity and solidarity between them. To this end, students will read seminal works by anti-caste and anti-race intellectuals and activists. Together, we will seek to understand the affective experiences at stake by watching films, listening to podcasts, and reading poetry and fiction. The focus will be on the analysis of innovative strategies of resistance offered against caste and race, and modes through which the discriminated claimed selfhood and emerged as subjects. Students will also examine how race and caste privileges that operate at an everyday level are directly linked with histories of discrimination and perpetuate structural exploitation. Finally, we will have a chance to compare the emergence of Critical Caste Studies as a new disciplinary approach alongside the rise of Critical Race Studies.",Winter,"HIST 26814, CRES 22211, SALC 25324",,Sanjukta Poddar

We will engage with these plural transpacific circulations - individuals, resources, goods, ideas, and sensibilities - through diverse material ranging from maps, poetry, visual arts, films, and essays to music, architecture, textiles, and social media. We will question the local and global implications of these exchanges in a (post)colonial world. A navigation between eras and areas, this course takes transpacific cultural relations as an opportunity to decenter the gaze. What do these early and dynamic circulations tell us about a globalization always centered on the (North) West of the planet? What happens with the old presumed categories of ""West"" and ""East"" when the world is lived and conceived from other locations and perspectives? What remains of ""Latin"" when America is apprehended from the ""Pacific Rim""? Drawing on close observations and analysis of representative cultural productions, this course seeks to map the importance and diversity of these transpacific cultural itineraries and to explore alternative ways of thinking about ""Latin America"" as a central agent of our connected modernities. Besides enhancing your knowledge of Latin American cultural history, this course is designed to help you improve your close reading and critical thinking skills, as well as continue building on your linguistic competence in Spanish.",,"SPAN 22523, LACS 22523",,Ysé Bourdon

The discourse of diaspora remains foundational for several interdisciplinary fields, including Black studies, Asian American studies, Indigenous studies, Latinx studies, and more. Within these intellectual orientations, diasporic identities are notably expansive and unfixed. As observed by the late cultural theorist Stuart Hall, ""diaspora identities are those which are constantly producing and reproducing themselves anew, through transformation and difference,"" bridging old and new traditions of worldmaking, resistance, and solidarities within and across distinct diasporic sensibilities."" Students in this class will work with scholarly, literary, sonic, and visual materials demonstrating how use of diaspora alternately mobilizes and roots people, in ways that claim pasts and futures at once.",Spring,"HIST 12706, RDIN 12200, CRES 12700, PLSC 22200",,Adom Getachew

To explore transnational articulations of queerness we will draw on a range of theoretical perspectives, including postcolonial, feminist, queer, and indigenous approaches to the study of sexualities. We will engage with scholarship on the politics of global gay rights discourses, on the sexual politics of migration, and on the effects of colonialism and neoliberal capitalism.

GLST 23825,Human Rights in the Middle East. 100 Units.,"This seminar explores the broad range of human rights struggles, concerns and activism in the contemporary Middle East region. The class will examine human rights issues posed by authoritarian, dictatorial and single-party state formations in the Middle East particularly by looking at the effects of internal security apparatuses, mechanisms of state violence, and struggles for political participation and liberty. We explore ongoing indigenous struggles for recognition and autonomy, such as the Kurdish, Sahrawi and Amazigh cases, while also contextualizing the region's complex history of colonial and neocolonial interventions by force and their human rights implications. We will examine the varied roles that non-state actors play in Middle Eastern human rights spheres, from militias to NGOs to religious and communal structures. The course will look to local actors and movements to explore forms of resistance, struggle, and social change while maneuvering through often highly-constrained political spaces. We pay particular attention to marginalized communities by looking at the rights struggles of minorities, women, children, migrant workers, the disabled, and the LGBTQ+ community in Middle Eastern contexts. Personal Status Laws and their effects on rights, especially with regard to marital relations and parental rights are considered. Interdisciplinary and varied modes of knowledge production including film serve as source materials.",Spring,"NEHC 23825, HMRT 23825, NEHC 33825, HMRT 33825",,"Lindsay Gifford, Pozen Center for Human Rights Assistant Research Professor"
GLST 24202,Justice in an Unjust World: Theories of Justice. 100 Units.,"Justice as a possibility, an ideal, and as a telos is fundamental to theological and philosophical systems of ethics. Yet, each theory was formulated within and against a deeply unjust world. Every theory of justice implies an anthropology and an ontology, and each asks the question: Why isn't life fair? How can we can we create a just society against a world that is so obviously unjust? Each theory then proposes a just solution and every theory implies a set of practices that can be interrogated. As our contemporary society becomes more sharply divided, the issues of distribution, obligation, entitlement, fair exchanges of social goods and labor, and the fair sharing of social burdens becomes more important and demanding of more inquiry. This seminar will interrogate several theories of justice, beginning in classic Hellenistic texts and moving forward to the animating theories of the classic liberal tradition: libertarianism, utilitarianism, social contract theory, and Marxism. We will then turn to other sources of justice theory such as Catholic liberation theology, capacity theory, and Jewish justice theory. We will also use our seminar to explore contemporary cases in law, medicine, science and policy that raise issues of justice and injustice. While the seminar will focus on distributive practices, we will also explore how these practices structure our systems of retributive and restorative justice.",Spring,"RLST 24102, PBPL 23305",,Laurie Zoloth

Through our particular emphasis on solidarity movements arising from the global South, we consider a point in time during which shouts for political and economic equality among nations envisioned potential futures that would alter the global landscape. What transformed perceptions of the 'Third World' from a loose coalition of governments that sought to upend contemporary global structures, into an amorphous constitution of states perpetually in need of humanitarian aid? Over the course of the quarter we will explore these trajectories through a mixture of primary documents and visual sources, contextualized by both foundational historical scholarship and more recent interventions. Short writing assignments, library and museum visits, and class discussions will culminate in an opportunity for students to use course themes to design their own exhibit according to their own interests.",Spring,"CRES 21306, HMRT 23406",,"Eilin Rafael Pérez, Graduate Lecturer"
GLST 24500,The Just War. 100 Units.,"Questions about war, the taking of human life, the obligations of citizenship, the role of state power, and international justice are among the most pressing topics in ethics and political life. This class will examine these matters through a close reading of Michael Walzer's Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations, first published in 1977 and now in its 5th edition. Widely considered a classic in the ethics of war, JUW develops a theory for evaluating whether to enter war as well as decisions within war-what are known as the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello. Walzer applies his theory to a number of actual cases, ranging from military interventions to reprisals to terrorism to insurgencies to nuclear policy, all informed by the history of warfare and arguments in the history of Western thought. We will critically examine Walzer's theory, his use of cases, and the conclusions to which his arguments lead. Along the way, we'll examine core ideas in political morality, e.g., human rights; state sovereignty; morality, necessity, and extremity; liability and punishment, nonviolence, and killing and murder.",Spring.

No one has ever been able to find their roots, and their peculiar language is not related to any other in the world, but they have managed to keep their mysterious identity alive, even if many other civilizations tried to blot it out. The aim of this course is to create real situations that will enable the students to learn the meaning of Basque culture. It will be a guided tour throughout Basque history and society. Students will learn about the mysterious origins of the language; they will visit the most beautiful places of the Basque country; they will get to know and appreciate Basque traditions, gastronomy, music . . . and most importantly, they will be able to compare and contrast their own cultures and share their ideas during the lessons, creating an enriching atmosphere full of entertaining activities, such as listening to music, reading legends and tales, watching documentaries, and much more.",,"SPAN 24701, BASQ 24700",,

Starting with the Indian term ahiṃsā (literally ""non-injury""), we will examine classical Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions of non-violence as the foundations for its later adaptations in Christian and secular contexts. Gandhi's reinterpretation of Hindu sacred texts informed his anti-colonial movement, which directly influenced Mandela and MLK. Studying the interconnected biographies of these three figures, we will consider the powers and limitations of non-violence for their movements against colonization, apartheid, and systemic racism. Students' final projects will then argue how non-violence impacts a protest movement of their choice: for example, Black Lives Matter, the farmers' protests in India, or civil disobedience in Hong Kong.

In this course, we will put ""big philanthropy"" under the microscope. In other words, we will discuss frameworks to understand and assess the philanthropy of the richest people in the world. We will ask: What are the conditions of possibility for this philanthropy? How has the wealth channeled through such philanthropy been earned, and does it matter? How does big philanthropy frame socio-economic problems, and what solutions does it posit for these problems? Is philanthropy ideologically neutral? What are the impacts of such philanthropy on public policies in health, education, agriculture and more across the globe? What is the relationship between philanthropy, inequality, and democracy? And finally, what are the alternatives to big philanthropy? We will answer these questions through the critical examination of the philanthropic programs and claims of foundations established by Bill and Melinda Gates, the Rockefellers, the Walton Family, and George Soros among others.

How has emancipation been articulated in relation to religion, and how has this relationship revealed complications in modern ideas of freedom? How has religion functioned as a vehicle for racialization, and how has it been racialized itself? Is religion an impediment to freedom or a means for its actualization? Beginning in the European Enlightenment, we will consider these questions in relation to two distinct, though (crucially) related sites: Jewish emancipation in 18th and 19th century Europe, and Black emancipation in the United States. In doing so, we will treat the relationship between religion, race, and emancipation as a central tension of the modern period, the continuing importance of which has significant consequences for liberatory intellectual and political movements in the present.

We think about links between conceptions of travel and broader historical and social structures, considering the histories of class-exclusive travel, ways that colonialism has shaped travel, and the ethics of travel with respect to its impact on both local communities and the environment.

The aim of this course is to learn more about the emergence of these two centers, and then explore the past, present and future of their relations. In recent years, the issue of religion has emerged as a crucial factor in Israel-Diaspora relations, especially in relation to the Jewish center in North America. The historical development of progressive Jewish strands in the United States, together with the fundamental changes in the religious makeup of Jewish society and the perception of the political role of religion in the state of Israel, have led to tension and strife regarding such issues as religious praxis, social identity and the public sphere.

Some have protested the close relationship between liberalism and capitalism. Some objected to liberalism's breakup of ""organic"" ethno-religious communities. And some maintained that liberalism is no more than Western imperialism with a human face. What happened? Were these revolts mere setbacks on the long 'arc of history'? Or were they, rather, a reflection of a deep philosophic unease with the very premises of modernity? Is this the end of the liberal world order? What will replace it?

HIST 17206,The United States in the 21st Century. 100 Units.,"This discussion-based common-year seminar is open to first- and second-year students interested in the discipline of history. The ambition of the course is to offer a ""history of the present"" of the United States. When does history give way to the present? When does the present become the proper subject of history? Asking these questions, the course underscores the ability of the historical method to find interconnections among subjects, whether it is culture, economy, climate, society, or politics, often kept separate by other disciplines. Topics covered will include: the US-led globalization of the turn of the second millennium and its fate; 9/11 and the War on Iraq; the rise of genomic science; transformations of identity, including gender, sexuality, race, and ethnicity; the economic origins and aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008 and the Great Recession; the elections of Obama and Trump; the birth of social media; the problem of climate change; the future of American democracy. Course materials will include political speeches, fiction and nonfiction books and essays, works of scholarship, film, music, and other media.",Spring,CCCT 17206,,J. Levy
HIST 18405,Histories of Native America. 100 Units.,"Modern Americans often think of their history beginning with the European discovery of the ""New World."" But those Europeans did not ""discover"" anything. In the Americas, they encountered an Old World filled with diverse Indigenous peoples, cultures, and polities; a world alive with its own dynamic histories. This course explores the world of Native North America from the evolution of complex city-states in the centuries before European invasion to the seismic changes that Indigenous peoples have navigated in the era of colonization (1492-present). Topics include Native struggles to create a shared world with settlers in the seventeenth century; movements to maintain independence from European empires and the new United States; nineteenth-century experiences of conquest, removal, confinement to reservations, and coercive assimilation; twentieth-century resurgence, battles in the courts, and ""Red Power"" activism; and twenty-first century struggles for sovereignty, self-determination, and environmental justice. Students will engage with a variety of primary and secondary sources, focusing on texts produced by Native people and centering Native points of view.",Winter,RDIN 18405,,M. Kruer

Breaking the glass ceiling, coming out of the closet, or crossing the color line in sports? This course will take up the question of why sports are so central to American identity and what historic role sports and athletes have played in American political life. Muhammad Ali, Billie Jean King, Jackie Robinson, and Bill Russell are only a few of the athletes who fought for freedom, inclusion, and equality in sports and American life. Through close critical readings of popular and scholarly writing, memoirs, and visual culture (film and television), we will examine the seminal overlapping events in sports history and American history to understand the collision and convergence of our politics and sports culture.",Winter,RDIN 18702,,M.

HIST 18808,Asian American History through the Novel. 100 Units.,"This course examines the interwoven histories of migration, language, and identity formation and re-formation in Asian American experience. How are migrant and diasporic identities represented in fictional (or quasi-fictional) terms? How have factors such as race, religion, class, gender, and sexuality shaped everyday Asian American life? Course readings consist primarily of novels, representing a variety of Asian ethnicities and experiences, by writers of Chinese, Filipina/o, Indian, Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese, and Vietnamese descent. These works are supplemented by selected historical documents and short lectures to shed additional light onto the sociohistorical contexts under study.",,"GNSE 18808, CRES 18808",,C. Kubler
HIST 20008,East Africa and the Indian Ocean. 100 Units.,"This course offers an introduction to the long history of East Africa in the Indian Ocean world. Areas of concentration will include trade and cultural interaction with the Middle East, South Asia, and East Asia, new dynamics in the context of European colonization, and East Africa's important place in decolonization and the Non-Aligned Movement. Along the way, we will ask some broad questions about the region. How are societies formed through processes of migration and interaction? What dynamics bind people together as distinct communities, and what factors lead them to break apart? How have ideas about gender and sex changed over time in East Africa? How are all these matters shaped by religion and cosmology? East African lives were shaped by forces external to the continent - but East Africans shaped those forces too. Along the way, we will analyze a wide variety of materials and viewpoints, including ones that are not conventionally used to tell stories about the past. These include archaeology, linguistics, oral traditions, environmental sources, written and archival materials, life histories, and visual and performed art.",Autumn,,,Daly Samuel Fury Childs
HIST 20012,"The Work of the Past: Colonialism, Slavery, Institutions. 100 Units.","In 1897, a British force destroyed the capital of the Kingdom of Benin-annexing the territory and looting the royal bronze sculptures. For over a century these sculptures, known as the Benin Bronzes, have been held in museums, universities, and private collections across the world. Yet in the past few years public and scholarly debates surrounding these objects has led to new conversations about the legacy of colonial violence in the contemporary world-and calls for material change. Now, led by the University of Iowa's Stanley Museum of Art in the United States and others abroad, these looted bronzes have or are in the process of being repatriated to Nigeria. This course will examine this case and others to demonstrate the continuing work of the past in the present; the ways groups and individuals have organized research projects to address historic violence: from creating digital humanities databases to major European Union initiatives; small student publications to extended newspaper investigative reporting. These projects illuminate the possibilities of addressing historic violence both in and beyond museums, universities, and other institutions. From forensic accounting to museum provenance reporting, archeological investigations to new legal specializations, students in this course will become familiar with types of historical research-especially collaborative projects-and gain familiarity with the possibilities and limitations of their transformative potential.",Winter,"LACS 30012, LACS 20012, HIST 30012, RDIN 20012, RDIN 30012",,K.

HIST 21206,"The Reformation in Britain, 1450-1660. 100 Units.","The Reformation in Britain is one of the most contested areas in early modern history. Was it mostly a political event, triggered by Henry VIII's desire for a divorce? Was it an organic movement from the ground up, inspired by the enthusiasm of ordinary believers in the same way as many reform movements in continental Europe? Did it have a distinctive theology of its own: can we call this 'Anglicanism'? Should we be studying the 'British Reformation' on its own terms at all, or should it be viewed simply as an offshoot of the continental European Reformations? And did the puritans really want to cancel Christmas? This course will give students a thorough grounding in the Reformation in Britain c.1450-1660, paying especial attention to the complex historiographical issues that still plague the topic to this day. Students will have the opportunity to study a range of key primary texts from the era, from John Foxe's Book of Martyrs to the letters of Queen Elizabeth I, as well as to examine the modern-day legacies of English reform.",Spring,"HIST 31206, HCHR 32604, RLST 22604",,Kirsten Macfarlane

It will focus on several major themes that have guided historical inquiry and show how hard drink intersects with and entangles these histories. Major themes will include alcohol and gender relations; state legality and taxation; moral policing; environmental projects and crises; labor and technology; and colonialism. Using both primary and secondary sources will push students to look below the surface to see how drink alternately challenged or reinforced social hierarchies, much as it continues to do in the present time.",,"HIPS 22207, HLTH 22207",,C.

Almost all people in this period, from peasant to prince, accepted it as a real and powerful presence in their lives. They respected its credibility and practices in general, even if they might question particular claims. In this course we address why it was so ubiquitous, what it involved, and why, in the end, it seemed to decline. The course will introduce students to the major arguments that historians in this field have advanced, and provide critical perspectives on the interpretation of the range of practices falling under the term ""magic,"" from witchcraft and necromancy to alchemy. Among the topics likely to be discussed are demonology, natural magic, astrology, the witch craze, the roles of memory, orality, and literacy in sustaining and qualifying magical cultures, and the relationships between magic, medicine, and science.",Spring,"CHSS 32211, HIPS 22211, HIST 32211",,A.

Founded by pagan warlords following the retreat of the Roman legions, the kingdoms of the Anglo-Saxons were already old when missionaries arrived from Rome in A.D. 597, bearing icons and Gospel books. What happened when their kings converted to Christianity? How did their language, law, politics, culture, society, and economy change? What roles did monks, warriors, women, merchants, and poets have in crafting a kingdom so richly endowed that William coveted it as his prize? This course charts the making of Anglo-Saxon England through close readings of primary sources, including histories, epic poems, liturgies, and laws, alongside archeological surveys and works of art.

We will use this broad theme to explore a variety of important issues in modern European history, including the history of the relationship of the church and state; the contribution of religious consciousness and culture to the construction of class, gender, and national identities; and the role played by religious movements in the creation of a liberal, adversarial political system and the formation of a bourgeois public sphere. Special topics will include the role of religious disputes in the formation of administrative reform agendas in the Eighteenth Century, the shifting patterns of religious practice that developed in the Nineteenth Century; the role of religiously-based political movements in the crisis of the Liberal state in the late Nineteenth and early Twentieth Centuries; the ambivalent relationship of the churches to National Socialism and the Vichy regime; the role of organized religion in the reconstruction and transformation of the European state system at the conclusion of World War II; and patterns of religious renewal in Europe in the 1960s.",Spring,HIST 32509,,J.

HIST 22604,Muslims and Jews in France and Its Empire: 1830 to the Present. 100 Units.,"In recent years, Muslim-Jewish relations in France have come to be portrayed as unbridgeable. This course asks how we got here. The course is designed to provide students with an introduction to the history of France and its empire through the lens of its Muslim and Jewish minorities. It begins with the French conquest of North Africa, interrogates the development of uneven French colonial policies towards Muslims and Jews, traces state violence against both groups from the Holocaust to the 1961 Paris massacre, and concludes with debates today over the right to wear the veil or kippah in public. The course provides students with practical skills in GIS mapping as a means to analyze the role space and place played in the production of Muslim-Jewish relations. Readings include key historiographical texts to introduce students to the major questions and debates, as well as primary sources and current events materials to formulate their own analyses. The course emphasizes the importance of fostering respectful, critical dialogue around often contentious topics. It does so with the aim of challenging students' pre-assumptions shaping their visions of a Muslim-Jewish past and present in order to reimagine a productive future. No previous skills in GIS mapping or French language knowledge required.",Spring,,,K. Schulman
HIST 23010,Themes in the European Reformation(s) 100 Units.,"This course provides an introduction to the study of the Reformation(s) in early modern Europe. As well as covering the key theological ideas of famous Protestant reformers (Luther; Zwingli; Calvin), it will give ample space to the impact that these religious revolutions had on contemporary society, including attitudes to gender, politics, economics, and visual/material culture. It will cover the reformations and renewals undergone by Catholicism in the same period, and discuss the key arguments, questions, and concerns which have preoccupied historians of the Reformation since the nineteenth century. Students will have the opportunity to read and engage with famous texts from the period (for instance Erasmus's On Free Will; Luther's 95 Theses; Calvin's Institutes) as well as lesser-known but still influential works (e.g. the poetry of the female Italian humanist Olympia Fulvia Morata and the writings of early Jesuit missionaries to China and Japan), in addition to historically significant documents (such as contemporary witchcraft confessions and extracts from Reformation demonologies).

HIST 23706,The Soviet Union. 100 Units.,"This lecture course surveys the making and unmaking of the Soviet Union as a society, culture, economy, superpower, and empire from 1917 to 1991. The Soviet Union began as an unprecedented radical experiment in remaking society and economy, ethnic and gender relations, personal identities, even human nature, but in the course of its history, it came to resemble other (capitalist) societies, sharing, in turn, their violence, welfare provisions, and consumerism. The story of this transformation-from being unique and exhilarating to being much like everyone else, only poorer and more drab-will be at the center of our exploration. The main themes of the course include social and cultural revolutions; ideology and the role of Marxism; political violence from the birth of the socialist state to the end of the Stalin terror; origins, practices, aesthetics, legacies, and critiques of Stalinism; law, dissent, and human rights; nationality policies and the role of ethnic minorities; the economy of shortages and the material culture it created; institutions of daily life (communal apartments, courtyards, peasant markets, dachas, and boiler rooms); socialist realism and the Soviet dreamworld.",Spring,REES 23706,,E.

Historical narratives of evolution center on Darwin's work, and scientific publications today still note whether or not Darwin pre-empted their ideas. This course aims to build a narrative of evolution that brings the story up to today, asking why so many see Darwin as a shorthand for evolution and what consequences that might have for the development and communication of the science. In addition, it will interrogate other ""iconic"" images and narratives in evolution, like the tree of life. We will ask where our ideas about evolution have come from, how they are perpetuated, and what consequence that might have for the discipline of evolutionary biology. The course has three aims: 1) to provide a historical understanding of evolution after Darwin; 2) to reflect on how evolution is communicated between scientists and to the broader public, and to ask how ""icons"" or Darwin himself suggest implicit meanings counter to the work of the scientists; and 3) to more broadly examine what is a science-a process or a body of knowledge?",Autumn.

What makes a ""good"" scientific image? What kind of work do scientific images do? What philosophical, ideological, and political constraints underwrite attempts to render the complexity of events and entities in the world in stylized visual vocabularies? And how might we approach the work of aesthetics and style in image-making? We will examine these questions through a survey of several contemporary scholarly frameworks used for thinking about problems of representation in scientific practice, and will attend to such image-making practices as graphing, diagramming, modeling, doodling, illustrating, sculpting, and photographing, among other methods.",Spring,"CHSS 35205, HIPS 25505, HIST 35205",,M.

HIST 25305,"Magic, Miracles, and Medicine: Healthcare in the Bible and the Ancient World. 100 Units.","This course examines the complex issues surrounding the body, disability, and medical care in antiquity. It will be guided by a variety of questions, such as what was the root cause of bodily infirmity and disease in antiquity? How did cultural views of sex, gender, and race influence perceptions of the body and what it meant to be able bodied? Such questions are significant when considering what kind of access to healthcare marginalized groups had. In order to explore these questions, we will examine ancient Mediterranean views of medical care through material remains (e.g., magical amulets and healing shrines) and textual evidence (e.g., Galen and Hippocrates). After considering this wider cultural context, we will examine treatments in the Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and early Christianity. We will also explore how Christian concepts of medical care evolved in light of accounts of Jesus as a divine healer. In addition to this ancient evidence, we will engage with modern disability studies and sociological analyses to better orient our readings. At the end of the course, students will be better acquainted with the complex relationship between religion and medicine and how that affects modern healthcare decisions.",Spring,"HIPS 20223, RLST 20223, CCTS 21021, JWSC 20923, HLTH 20223, KNOW 20223",,Richard Zaleski
HIST 25318,"Wonder, Wonders, and Knowing. 100 Units.","In wonder is the beginning of philosophy,"" wrote Aristotle; Descartes also thought that those deficient in wonder were also deficient in knowledge. But the relationship between wonder and inquiry has always been an ambivalent one: too much wonder stupefies rather than stimulates investigation, according to Descartes; Aristotle explicitly excluded wonders as objects of inquiry from natural philosophy. Francis Bacon called wonders ""broken knowledge."" Since the sixteenth century, scientists and scholars have both cultivated and repudiated the passion of wonder; On the one hand, marvels (or even just anomalies) threaten to subvert the human and natural orders; on the other, the wonder they ignite inquiry into their causes. Wonder is also a passion tinged with the numinous, and miracles have long stood for the inexplicable in religious contexts. Above all, wonders demand attention and interpretation.

This course will examine the development of Christian institutions and ideologies in relation to the distinctive social structures, political cultures, economies, and environments of the Middle East, with a focus on the Fertile Crescent. The makers of Middle Eastern Christianities were both saints and sinners. Holy men and women, monks, and sometimes bishops withdrew from what they often called ""the world"" with the intention of reshaping society through prayer, asceticism, and writing; some also intervened directly in social, political, and economic relations. The work of these saints depended on the cooperation of aristocrats, merchants, and rulers who established enduring worldly institutions.

As this course will reveal, the interlocutors of this question included rioting craftsmen and Janissaries, a local US vice-consul in Damascus, the nomads of the Syrian desert, émigré Syrian critics of the Ottoman Empire, agronomists invested in national economy, men of business as well as those of religion, and an authoritarian regime and a people who rose against it. As we unravel the social, political, economic, and intellectual processes that shaped the Syrian identity, we will cover milestone events such as the infamous interconfessional massacres of 1860, the end of the Ottoman Empire, the Baathist coup of 1963, or the Syrian Revolution in the context of the Arab Spring of the early 2010s. The course material will include scholarly texts as well as excerpts from Syrian texts, novels, and films in translation.",,"HIST 35908, NEHC 30116, KNOW 36085, NEHC 20116",,
HIST 26220,Brazil: Another American History. 100 Units.,"Brazil is in many ways a mirror image of the United States: an almost continental democracy, rich in natural resources, populated by the descendants of three continents, shaped by colonialism, slavery, and sui generis liberal capitalism. Why, then, has Brazil's historical path been so distinct? To explore this question, this course will focus on the history of economic development, race, citizenship, urbanization, the environment, popular culture, violence, and the challenge of democracy.

HIST 26305,Covid-19 and other epidemics in Latin American History. 100 Units.,"This course is designed as an introduction to the history of epidemics and pandemics in Latin America from the XVI century to the present. Emphasis will be on using epidemics and pandemics as historical lenses to illuminate key dimensions of Latin America's society like discrimination, citizenship, authoritarianism, popular resilience and globalization. We will discuss the relationship between epidemics and pandemics and international commerce, analyze the role played by structural inequities and inadequate responses by governments in the intensification of disease outbreaks, and assess popular reactions to government's action and inaction. An organizing principle of several sessions will be ""Necropolitics"" (a concept originally coined by Cameroonian philosopher Achille Mbembe) applied to social studies of health. These studies indicate that it is misleading to consider epidemics and pandemics as equal-opportunity threats since widespread disease outbreaks are usually more acute and tragic for vulnerable populations. A distinctive feature of necropolitics and Covid-19 was a misplaced hope for ""herd immunity"", embraced by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, namely the natural protection from an infectious disease that happens when a population is immune through previous infection, with the assumption that a large number of people had to die.",Autumn,"HIST 36305, LACS 25132, LACS 35132",,Marcos Cueto
HIST 26309,The Economic History of Latin America. 100 Units.,"The course explores Latin America's historical evolution, analyzing the factors that have promoted or limited its economic development from the 16th century to the present. It seeks to familiarize students with the main debates on the economic history of the region, including the most recent literature. Despite its diversity, Latin American countries share several common traits, linked to its past, that have resulted in lower levels of income and greater poverty than the Global North, and very high inequality by international standards. This course aims to acquaint students with Latin America's diversity and, at the same time, identify its common characteristics. The course will delve into the following traits, that although unevenly distributed through the region, have shaped Latin America's economic development: indigenous legacies, colonial extraction, slavery, European migration, political fragmentation and instability, integration into the global economy through commodities' exports, low educational levels, poor innovation and financial development, limited industrialization, and frequent macroeconomic crises.",Autumn,"LACS 25135, HIST 36309, LACS 35135",,Aurora Gómez Galvarriato
HIST 26606,Postcolonial and Decolonial History and Theory. 100 Units.,"This course introduces students to some key texts in post and decolonial theory. Our goals in this class are three-fold. First, to familiarize students with foundational thinkers who have inspired both decolonial and postcolonial work. We draw attention to the different ways in which their ideas have been deployed in subsequent post and decolonial scholarship. Second, we ask questions oriented towards comparison of postcolonial and decolonial approaches: What, if any, are the points of overlap between decolonial and postcolonial thought? How do both bodies of work critique and contest the legacies of empire? Third, we investigate the present and possible futures of decolonial and postcolonial thought.",Spring,"PLSC 20704, CDIN 20704, CCCT 20704, SALC 20704",,Rochona Majumdar & Lisa Wedeen
HIST 26617,How to Provoke a Public: Rhetorical Moves and Social Questions in Modern India. 100 Units.,"This course introduces students to some major communication genres that have shaped social and political life in modern India, including polemical tracts, reports, speeches, public performances, and manifestos. Students will learn how these texts tried to persuade their publics, compare their formal conventions, and evaluate the effectiveness of their rhetoric. The course follows a broad chronological arc, starting with polemical tracts challenging caste and gender inequality in colonial India in the late 19th century. Next, we will examine reports on labor concerns submitted by activists to the British government during the 1910s. We will then move on to public speeches from the 1920s and 30s that addressed issues such as organized religion and the annihilation of caste, followed by the use of the manifesto genre by anti-caste and sex workers' organizations in postcolonial India during the 1970s and 90s. The course concludes by considering alternative forms of public address through song performances by anti-caste activists in the 21st century. Running through this array of themes will be a methodological question: how do the social purposes of public texts inform their choices of address, formal devices, and modes of circulation? All readings will be in English, and no prior knowledge of South Asian history or languages is necessary.",Winter,"SALC 35420, SALC 25420",,Sthira Bharracharya

How did South Asian Muslims, especially in North India, respond to the many challenges and opportunities modernity brought in its wake? This course explores how custodians of Islamic religious and poetic traditions responded to colonial modernity. We also introduce some key ideas of postcolonial studies, and apply as well as think critically about them in the light of the Indo-Islamic case-study. We begin the course by exploring the possible meanings of modernity and colonialism, before diving deeper into Indo-Islamic modernity using two broad and highly intertwined themes: religion, encompassing subthemes of science, rationality, and progress, and literature, especially poetry and the fate of the Persian and Urdu ghazal tradition, occasionally making comparisons with other pre-colonial genres in other Indian languages. We will look at the creation of new genres and new kinds of poetry in Persian and Urdu that emerge both to answer the call of modernity and sometimes to reject and attack it.",Winter,SALC 25327,,Shariq Khan

Moving away from an earlier historiography, which treated science as a black-boxed, essentially European kind of knowledge that was diffused to the rest of the world, we will pay special attention to the role indigenous and vernacular forms of knowledge played in making modern science. We will range from the early modern period to the contemporary, and deal with a range of topics such as agriculture, industry, communications, biomedicine, water, religion, and capitalism.",Winter,"SALC 36815, HIST 36815, CHSS 36815, HIPS 26815, SALC 26815",,S.

The structure of the course is designed to approach and understand the intersection and melding of race and religion through literary, social scientific, historical and biographical angles. It is hoped that such variant approaches will deepen our understanding of a complex and changing reality, keeping in mind that ""race"" as a category and political and social reality has experienced profoundly different meanings in the course of the 20th century.

HIST 27211,The History of the Future. 100 Units.,"We are consumed with thoughts of the future. And why not? Recent events have assumed a pace so dizzying that easy answers-any answers, really-about our fate seem agonizingly out of reach. How and with what effects will the wars in Ukraine and Israel end? Does AI pose a threat to humanity, and if so, on what timetable and in what ways? What impact will climate change have on migration patterns, social organization, and real estate markets? These questions cut to the heart of the profound uncertainty that characterizes life in ""the digital age,"" ""the late Anthropocene,"" or whatever moniker future historians will eventually bestow to our anxiety-inducing times. As an idea, of course, ""the future"" has a history all its own. In this course, you will acquaint yourself with authors and texts that encapsulate the birth and maturation of futurist thought from the nineteenth century to the present. Moving from the speculative fiction of H.G. Wells to data-driven prediction models, you will explore the ways people have thought about the future, how some prescient souls were able to predict it, and why others got it so wildly wrong. With practice we will acquire a historical sensibility when evaluating the myriad-and hyperbolic!-visions of the future that compete for clicks today. Indeed, through the seminal texts you will explore in this course, you will ultimately discover that thinking about the future is, at heart, thinking about the past.",Spring,,,S. Buono

Of transnational connections? Of secularization? This course examines how historians have grappled with such questions. We will read the work of scholars who have offered narratives explaining American religious history, including figures like Sydney Ahlstrom, Albert Raboteau, Mark Noll, Ann Braude, Catherine Albanese, and Thomas Tweed. This course will introduce students to key historiographical questions in the study of American religion, as well as to classic texts which have shaped the field's development.",Autumn,"AMER 21315, RAME 41315, AMER 41315, CRES 22315, HCHR 41315, RLST 21315, RDIN 41315, HIST 47304, RDIN 21315, KNOW 41315",,William Schultz and Curtis Evans
HIST 27316,"Soundtrack for Changing the World: Mavis Staples, Chicago, & the Music of the Civil Rights Movement. 100 Units.","Mavis Staples was nine years old in 1948 when she joined her father, Roebuck ""Pops' Staples and three siblings to form the Chicago gospel group The Staple Singers. Inspired by the rich musical crosscurrents of the South Side, the Staples fused gospel vocal harmonies with Delta Blues guitar to create a revolutionary form of American music. In the 1960s, the group collaborated with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and traveled the back roads of the South at great personal risk to spread his message. Their music became synonymous with the Civil Rights Movement. A lifelong South Side resident, Mavis Staples continues to blend soul, blues, folk, gospel and rock in her albums and has worked with Bob Dylan, Prince, Public Enemy's Chuck D and Wilco's Jeff Tweedy. Students in this interdisciplinary course will blend journalism, history, biography, and musicology to illuminate the pioneering path mapped out by Mavis Staples and her family. The students will explore how art and activism intertwine, and how popular music sparks democratic change. Students will create research projects grounded in the Staples' epic history by developing oral histories and drawing on recordings, photographs, manuscripts, newspapers, film, and video in archives nationwide. Students will be able to further their work by applying for Summer 2025 travel grants and research fellowships.

HIST 27409,Blackness and the Problem of the Archive. 100 Units.,"This course will explore the question what ""what is an archive?"" from the perspective of Black theorists, historians, artists and historical actors. We will come to understand how the ""archival turn,"" or the scholarly reimagining of the essential nature of the archive presents a range of problems for researching black life. As theorists redefined the archive from a physical repository of textual materials collected by the state to a quasi-metaphorical, hegemonic site of violence and illegibility, traditional forms of historical inquiry and narration came under intense scrutiny. These critiques generated a number of questions which we will ponder together. Can the everyday realities of black subjects-be they enslaved, working-class, female or queer-be recovered through archival texts? How is agency expressed (or not expressed) in the archive? And why? Can archives exist as anything other than repositories for the reproduction of elite consciousness? Or as sites of distortion and dehumanization? With these discussions as our backdrop we will additionally explore imagination and possibility in the archives, asking what Black people's archival practices tell us about human expression and memory. Alongside conceptual texts we will also engage in archival practice as a group. The course will culminate in each student producing a research project which critically engages with a local Black archive in Chicago, or a digital repository of their choosing.",,,,M. Hicks
HIST 27416,Black Religious Protest in the U.S. 100 Units.,"This course examines African American religious protest against the American nation for its actual history and its ideals in view of black oppression. The course begins with David Walker's Appeal (1829) and ends with debates around Jeremiah Wright's ""God damn America"" sermon. The course situates black religious protest amidst discussions of the American Jeremiad, a particular critique of the nation in relation to the divine, American exceptionalism, and racial injustice.

Today, it is nearly synonymous with criminal punishment, and the U.S. incarcerates nearly 2 million people. How did this transformation occur, and how did it shape law, politics, and culture? This course traces the legal, political, and cultural history of incarceration, from the establishment of the first prisons in the eighteenth century to the contemporary phenomenon of mass incarceration. We will examine how the use of incarceration has expanded but also how it has been continually reimagined: as a form of penitence, a source of labor, a means of rehabilitation, and a way to remove people labeled dangerous from the community. We will attend to the relationship between incarceration and racial formation. We will study non-criminal forms of incarceration, such as immigrant detention and involuntary commitment. We will also examine prison narratives and other literary works, focusing on how incarcerated and formerly incarcerated people narrated their own experiences.",,,,

For some, corporations are modern marvels of American capitalism-models of growth, efficiency, and cooperation. For others, they are grotesque symbols of excess-selfish concentrations of wealth, capital, and power. Regardless of the emotions associated with the institution, it remains ubiquitous within American political economy. Drawing on a range of recent legal, economic, and historical scholarship, this research based, writing intensive, seminar interrogates the role of corporations within American society by asking questions such as: what, if anything, do corporations owe the state and society; does business have a ""social responsibility;"" to whom/what is the corporation accountable; and what role should state and federal governments play in regulating these consequential institutions?

HIST 28308,"Science, Governance, and the Crisis of Liberalism. 100 Units.","In the era of ""post-truth"" it has become common to link a crisis of scientific authority with a crisis of liberalism. Democracies around the world are under threat, this reasoning goes, in part because of an attack on scientific truth. But what does liberalism - as political culture and as a form of governance - need (or want) from science? Depending where you look, the answer might appear to be facts, truth, a model 'public sphere,' an ethic of objectivity, tactics for managing risk and uncertainty, or technologies of population management (to name a few). In addition to exploring the complex historical relationship between science and liberalism in the modern era, this course will critically assess how the history of science and the history of political thought have theorized truth and governance. We will examine what models of ""coproduction"" and ""social construction"" - nearly ubiquitous in the historiography of modern science - fail to capture about the histories of science and state power. We will also think about how political and intellectual historians' theories of truth and mendacity in politics might be enriched by more attention to scientific knowledge in both its technical and epistemological forms. This course focuses on 19th- and 20th-century Europe and the United States in global perspective, and readings will draw from political theory, history, economic thought, the natural and human sciences, and critical theory.",Autumn,"CHSS 32504, HIPS 22204, HIST 38308, KNOW 32204",,Isabel Gabel

We explore how these various iterations have not only coexisted over time but also intersected, reinforced, and-at times-complicated each other. We will ask how these overlapping spectacles shaped and continue to shape the United States by underwriting and innovating race, class, gender, and statecraft.

Focusing on the archives and museums dedicated to the genocide of Indigenous peoples, slavery, and the Holocaust, we will discuss the following questions: What is an object of trauma? What makes its way to a depository of traumatic events, what does not, and why? What do archivists and curators hope to accomplish? What stories can be told, given that so many of the voices of victims are irretrievable? What happens to a remnant of trauma once it is in the custody of a museum or an archive? What is the relationship between archives of trauma and their exhibition? We will consider the traumatic remains that have been deposited both in specialized and in general archives and museums.

HIST 29806,Archival Methods and Historical Thinking. 100 Units.,"Archival Methods & Historical Thinking interrogates the concepts, theories, and practices of the archive from a historical perspective. In many ways, history is a discipline defined by a set of questions rather than a singular approach. We will begin by analyzing how historians do the work of interpreting sources to construct historical narratives and arguments. Then, examining archival theory, its lapses, and its possibilities, we will determine what characteristics make an archive and how we can historicize it as an object of inquiry in its own right. We will then tackle a representative sample of the types of sources and archives you are most likely to engage as a social science researcher. Looking at how people have archived written ephemera, material culture, photographs, film, music, urban space, and the internet, we will pair the specific theoretical concerns of a given source type's archiving with practical examples of how social scientists have explicitly mediated, transcended, or succumbed to the experience of the archive: its structure, its customs, its absences, and more. You will gain an understanding of the mechanics of archival work for a social science researcher as well as an appreciation for the complexity of historical thinking. By the end of the course, you will learn how to reconcile archival theory with the realities and practices of research in order to become better, more ethical, and more rigorous researchers.",Summer.

In recent years legal history has taken a global turn, moving away from the state-focused approach that long characterized the field. We will consider some of the questions that have come out of that turn. What counts as a ""legal"" institution, and who decides? How do different legal traditions - Civil Law, Sharia, Common Law, custom - interact with one another? How did law buttress or challenge ideas about race? Law can be a shield or a weapon, sometimes simultaneously. What it does depends on who is using it, and for what purpose. Readings will include history and some legal philosophy. Students will use primary sources extensively, including court records. The course will address historical topics including the use of law in European imperialism; law and the afterlife of Atlantic slavery; colonial regimes of law; the role of law in nationalist movements; law in revolutionary regimes and communist states; and contemporary debates on law enforcement and policing.",Autumn,"LLSO 29911, HIST 39911",,S.

It may also be the least appreciated for its ongoing influence on Jewish identity and memory. We will apply social and memory theory to the Binding of Isaac (Genesis 22:1-19), and its interpretations in rabbinic literature, historical chronicles, and literature, in order to better understand the ways in which foundational narratives and cultural identities engage in a process of continuous mutual interpretation. We will also examine how technology and social media are customizing memory, and dramatically reshaping cultures and their collective memories.",Spring,"RLST 26622, FNDL 28750, JWSC 28750",,Aslan Cohen Mizrahi
HIST 29915,Tutorial - PIG HISTORY: East Meats West. 100 Units.,"If we are what we eat, we're mostly Chinese pigs. Pigs make up the largest part of the global meat market pound for pound, and China produces and consumes about half of the world's pigs, most of which are produced with methods and technology owned by US/UK based agribusinesses. Not only does the Chinese appetite for pigs sustain the global pork industry, it also curated most of the genetic material from which today's industrial pig is formed. Pigs in China were penned as early as six to seven thousand years ago, becoming temperamentally and biologically adjusted to living in captivity, unlike their half-wild European brethren, who were loosely kept under inverse conditions of relative land abundance and labor scarcity. Crossing lean, large, and fast-growing European pigs with fat, docile, and early maturing Chinese ones enabled pigs to make it onto industrializing meat markets in the 19th century. The rest, as they say, is history. Beginning with prehistoric pigs and their multiple sites of domestication, tracing their role in industrializing Britain, colonizing the Americas, feeding soldiers and export markets, and the rise of global agribusiness, this class invites an exploration of modernity from a pig perspective.",Autumn.

HIST 13001-13002-13003,History of European Civilization I-II-III.,"Has Europe ever been civilized? This sequence, which satisfies the general education requirement in civilization studies, invites students to discuss the simultaneously creative and destructive forces inherent in centuries of European history. While resisting shallow critiques and caricatures of Europe's role in the world, students examine in depth major themes in the history of European ideas about civilization, including the interplay of faith, reason, and secularism; the individual, family, and mass society; and monarchy, revolution, and democracy. Students not only grapple with big questions and transformative ideas but also consider unique perspectives and ordinary people by reading a variety of different kinds of historical evidence. The sequence provides students with foundational skills and knowledge for the University of Chicago general education core curriculum more broadly, which owes much of its intellectual project to European ideas of knowledge and education. In keeping with the traditions of the core curriculum, students contextualize and interrogate sources in small, rigorous, and textually immersive classes. Learn to think historically!

HIST 13001,History of European Civilization I. 100 Units.,"The first part of the sequence examines the period from approximately 500 to 1700 in European history. It challenges students to question two-dimensional, rigid narratives about the fall of Rome, the Dark Ages, the Renaissance and Reformation, and the early Enlightenment by reading historical sources with empathy and attention to their authors' own perspectives. For example, we explore the entanglement of the political, economic, and religious by reading a chronicle written by a monk; we examine gender relations and daily life by reading men's and women's personal letters; and we investigate the earliest contacts between Europeans and the peoples of the Americas by reading eyewitness accounts of their interactions. In the process of recovering the lived experiences of medieval and early modern Europeans, the course engages with the sophisticated societies and cultures of premodern Europe, which many subsequent generations post-1700 would come to label backwards and uncivilized.",Autumn,SOSC 28001,Students must take a minimum of two quarters of European Civilization to fulfill the general education requirement.,Staff

Major topics include the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, industrialization, the world wars, and the European Union. This course challenges students to do more than simply define conceptual terms like imperialism, nationalism, liberalism, capitalism, and communism. We situate these and other grand narratives in new ideas of progress, new technologies and forms of knowledge production, and the material transformations of everyday life. Changes in media (newspapers, radio, films, etc.) and the rise of mass production and consumption in these centuries were both the cause and effect of many of the events we will be discussing. Sources include nineteenth-century novels, eyewitness accounts to revolution and the Holocaust, and speeches and manifestos of the political and cultural avant-garde. Throughout the course, we will continuously examine the paradoxes that have shaped modern Europe: its resilience and fragility, its great experiments in liberty and tragic acts of violence.",Spring,SOSC 28002,HIST 13001,Staff

HIST 13900-14000-14100,"Russia and Eurasia: Empires, Societies, Cultures I-II-III.","This sequence is an introduction to the histories of Russia and Eurasia between the ninth century and the present. Rather than treat Russia as a stable entity, we ask how Russia was constituted under different political formations. What political and cultural notions animated Russian expansionism and Russia’s relations with other countries and neighboring peoples? What role did violence play in the making of Russian and Soviet polities, societies, and empires? How did literature and the arts represent the social order, interact with power, and condition individual choices and identities? And how did individuals, Russian and non-Russian alike, shape their lives within, and against, social, political, and imperial structures? In pursuing these questions, we take a comparative view, locating Russia in regional and transnational contexts. We analyze a wide array of primary sources: oral legends, hagiographies, and iconic literary texts; political treatises, diplomatic missives, government decrees, and secret police reports; city plans, paintings and photographs, film, and pop and rock music. We read authors who wrote in Russian about Russia, and also about Bashkortostan, Chechnya, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Estonia, Uzbekistan, and more.

Throughout the quarter, we will read short fiction from a variety of Russian authors and examine the texts that establish the tradition of Russian short fiction as well as those that push its boundaries. This course will serve as a general survey of Russian Literature, as well as a focused introduction to a particular genre in that tradition.

HIST 20405,Ancient Empires VI: The Assyrian Empire. 100 Units.,"This course will examine the concept and definition of empire and the practices of imperial control through a case study of Mesopotamia's best-known empire, the Neo-Assyrian (first half of the 1st millennium BCE). At its peak, the Assyrians ruled a vast area covering most of modern Iraq and Syria, plus parts of Iran, Turkey and the Levant, with aspirations to control Egypt. The gradual expansion of this empire from late 2nd millennium BCE beginnings and its extremely rapid collapse in ca. 612 BCE provide an excellent example of the tensions within trajectories of empire. The course themes include warfare and political strategies, identity and ethnicity, imperial bureaucracy, and the practical and ideological purposes of infrastructure building. Evidence examined will include texts (in translation) and the archaeological record at various scales, from settlements through artworks. We will also examine paradoxes, such as the contrast between textual claims of hegemony and limited archaeological evidence for this, and the power of visual propaganda versus its select audience.",Spring,NEHC 20016,,Augusta McMahon
HIST 20406,Ancient Empires VII: Sumerians and Akkadians. 100 Units.,"The course introduces students to the first 'empires' in the ancient Middle East. We will study the earliest attempts under both Sumerian and Akkadian leadership at unifying the old Sumerian city states in what is today southern Iraq in the mid-third millennium BCE. Our focus will then be on the two successful empires that arose from these attempts, namely the one founded by Sargon of Akkade in ca. 2300 BCE and the one ruled by the Third Dynasty of Ur from 2092-2003 BCE. While exploring a rich variety of sources, both textual and from archaeological contexts, we will pay particular attention to understanding expansionist efforts, strategies of empire building, the establishment of a centralized state bureaucracy, ideologies of kingship, ethnicity and identity, as well as rebellions against the new political system and theories about why these early empires began to crumble after only a few generations. Since these new forms of dominion were tested and developed for the first time in this formative period and kings of these dynasties acquired a special status in Mesopotamian cultural memory, this course provides a solid base for understanding the later development of ancient Middle Eastern history but can also be studied for the sake of understanding early empire formation.",Spring,NEHC 20017,,Jana Matuszak

Seawalls and cities rose in coastal areas that were previously untouched along Japan's coast; cement-dams replaced dirt dikes that divided the Han river in the Korean Peninsula; and railroads expanded into far-off regions in China, redefining both cities and hinterlands. These are three archetypal examples of technically complex projects that this course will explore. These industrial and technological projects of a national, regional, or global scale connect past to present and pose questions to our future about climate change, public health crises, and energy anxieties. This class asks what engineered environments are and how they shape our everyday life. We will visit three types of archetypal megaprojects-the railway system, the transformation of ocean space, and the building of dams--in China, Japan, and Korea that have shaped and continue to shape the environments of East Asia, an economically vibrant, politically challenging, and ecologically diverse region, with a deep history and vibrant technological innovations even today. We will discuss the politics and science behind the building of each megaproject, the interconnected history among them, and more importantly, how each project generated its environment, shaped the relationship between human societies and nature, and influences our current understanding of the region.",,HIST 15005,,Y.

HIPS 20574,How to Think Sociologically. 100 Units.,"This course tackles the ""big problem"" of low sociological literacy. When faced with the problems of the world, people usually resort to economic, biological, or ideological explanations. They cite self-interest, genetically encoded drives, or some pre-given understanding of how the world works. The price of such simple frameworks is an impoverished view of the world, a lack of understanding and empathy, and a predisposition to orthodoxy or ideology. In this sense, low sociological literacy is a big problem in the world today. This course was developed in the belief that the capacity to think sociologically-that is, to understand people as socially embedded, or shaped by the situations in which they find themselves-can enrich our understanding of the world immeasurably. It can give us analytical purchase on a number of social problems, including poverty; social inequality; racial, class, and gender discrimination; urban segregation; populism and political polarization; and organizational wrongdoing (we'll discuss each of these topics in class). A sociological perspective can also transform how we engage with the world, promoting an ethics of understanding and empathy--as opposed to the ethics apparently prevalent today: judging people and insisting they change.",Winter,"SOCI 20574, SOCI 30574, CHSS 30574",,M.

""Who are we to close doors?"" he asked rhetorically. It was both a metaphor for spiritual inclusion and an accurate representation of the modern Vatican's position on the possibilities of modern astrobiology and the search for extrasolar planets, fields whose rapid growth over the past two decades make serious consideration of extraterrestrial life seem like a uniquely modern phenomena. Its history, however, is in fact many centuries old. In this course we will examine the development of beliefs concerning life in the universe from the sixteenth century to the present. How did historical actors understand the nature, abilities, and location of extraterrestrial life, and its relationship to man and god? We will analyze connections between these beliefs and contemporary political, social, scientific, and religious developments. These include the role of the plurality of worlds in the debates over heliocentrism, its impact and application in the context of deism and social and political freethought, its literary and artistic depictions and use as a tool of satire and social commentary, its influence on natural philosophy, its decline and the subsequent rise of alien conspiracists and their critics, and how and why conceptions of the extraplanetary other took a dark and sinister turn toward the early-to-mid twentieth century.",,"ECEV 31409, KNOW 21409, HIST 24917",,

We will critically examine how new modes of scientific inquiry brought Africans, Americans, and Europeans into contact and conflict. Along the way, we will ask how, why, and with consequences imperial science created new knowledge claims about human inequality, especially racial and sexual difference. We will draw primarily on British, Iberian, and French imperial agendas in order to track the experiences of men and women from all corners of the Atlantic world, including indigenous peoples, enslaved black Africans, free people of color, and white Europeans. Through a variety of primary and secondary sources, we will uncover European aspirations to curate, control, and exploit the natural world and the agency of subjugated peoples in responding to and resisting these designs.

This interdisciplinary course seeks answers to this question by exploring how eighteenth-century scientific and medical ideas, technologies, and practices interacted with and influenced contemporary notions of sex, sexuality, and gender. In our course, the terms ""sex,"" ""Enlightenment,"" and ""science"" will be problematized in their historic contexts using a variety of primary and secondary sources. Through these texts, as well as images and objects, we will see how emerging scientific theories about sex, sexuality, and gender contributed to new understandings of the human, especially female, body. We will also see how the liberating potential of Enlightenment thought gave way to sexual and racial theories that insisted on fundamental human difference. Topics to be covered include theories of generation, childbirth, homosexuality, monstrosities, race and procreation, and hermaphrodites and questions about the ""sex"" of the enlightened scientist and the gendering of scientific practices.",,"HIST 22218, CHSS 31413, GNSE 21413, KNOW 21413",,

We will consider a general argument for your consideration: that the arguments and the practices from faith traditions and from philosophy offer significant contributions that underlie policies and practices in bioethics. We will use a case-based method to study how different traditions describe and defend differences in moral choices in contemporary bioethics. This class is based on the understanding that case narratives serve as another core text for the discipline of bioethics and that complex ethical issues are best considered by a careful examination of the competing theories as work themselves out in specific cases. We will examine both classic cases that have shaped our understanding of the field of bioethics and cases that are newly emerging, including the case of research done at our University. Through these cases, we will ask how religious traditions both collide and cohere over such topics as embryo research, health care reform, terminal illness, issues in epidemics and public health, and our central research question, synthetic biology research. This class will also explore how the discipline of bioethics has emerged to reflect upon such dilemmas, with particular attention to the role that theology and philosophy have played in such reflection.",,"SIGN 26069, RLST 24103, HLTH 24103, RETH 30600",,Laurie Zoloth
HIPS 24240,Buddhism and Science: A Critical Introduction. 100 Units.,"Buddhism is the only religion able to cope with modern scientific needs."" This quotation, often erroneously attributed to Albert Einstein, prompts the question: Why are such statements about Buddhism so easily taken nowadays as credible and plausible? Currently, it seems no other religion is held as compatible with science as Buddhism: From the recent 'mindfulness' craze in psychology and medicine, to the 'Emptiness' of quantum physics, Buddhism is uniquely hailed as a 'rational religion' whose insights anticipated modern science by millennia. Some even suggest it is not a 'religion' at all, but rather a sort of 'mind-science.' This course functions as both an introduction to Buddhism and a critical survey of its modern scientific reception. As we explore Buddhism's relationship to contemporary scientific theories in psychology and physics, we will be guided by questions such as: What methodological principles distinguish the practices of religion and science? What are the different ways they can be brought into relation? Why is Buddhism, in particular, singled out as uniquely scientific? What modern historical factors, like colonialism and secularization, contribute to this contemporary meme? Why does it matter whether Buddhism is compatible with science or not? What, exactly, is at stake in this relationship? And for whom? No prior study of Buddhism or the philosophy of science is expected.",Spring,"RLST 24240, KNOW 24240, CCTS 21018",,Jesse Berger

Most of us learn in high-school biology that life is some combination of growth, reproduction, and animation, and that it always contains DNA. Yet upon reflection, this definition is unsatisfying. This quarter we will explore some of the philosophical implications of modern biology by reading some of the best twentieth-century thinkers on the subject. The authors we will read have distinct theories about the nature of life, but they share the belief that understanding organic life, not simply spiritual or intellectual life, but the material basis of existence, is a fundamental task for thought. What makes these texts so exciting is that they were written during a time when biology itself was undergoing a series of profound revolutions, most notably (for us), the molecular turn and the discovery of the structure of DNA. As a result of these discoveries, ultimately some thinkers came to wonder, does life exist at all? After taking this course you will have a grounding in the core philosophical problems that are raised by modern biology about the concept of life. You will gain an understanding of the ways that science, far from simply providing answers, continually furnishes us with new questions about the nature of existence, many of which may be outside the scope of science itself.

This period has long been implicated in the ""conflict thesis""-a hugely influential argument that portrays the centuries-long relationship between religion and science/medicine as an inherently adversarial one. This course shall scrutinize that argument through a discussion of seemingly contradictory examples where reformers that touted the all-encompassing reach of divine providence also promoted intricate public health infrastructures; where the Vatican increasingly relied on university-trained physicians to validate saints and their miracles; where theologians were viewed as authorities on Galen and responsible for medical breakthroughs; and where medicine and metaphysics were considered complementary pursuits. Ultimately, students will unveil a portrait not of conflict, but of a symbiotic relationship between religion and medicine.

In the texts we will read, numerous notions of ""nature"" can be discerned: for instance, nature as the physical form of an individual, nature as an underlying reality of someone or something, nature as an autonomous thing distinct from human art and from the supernatural, nature as the all-encompassing natural order, or nature as the natural environment. The conceptual and ideological work done by these conceptions also varies wildly. Furthermore, the images associated with the concepts are similarly diverse, ranging from human bodies to magical plants and cosmic spheres, and with a comparable repertory of conceptual and ideological purposes. Yet discussions of the concept of nature typically deal almost exclusively in abstractions: this is true, for instance, of the standard study of physis written over a century ago as a U of C dissertation, which we will read in excerpt.

HMRT 10100,Human Rights in World Civilizations I. 100 Units.,"The first quarter begins with a set of conceptual problems and optics designed to introduce students to the critical study of human rights, opening up questions of the universal, human dignity, and the political along with the practices of witness and testimony. It is followed by two thematic clusters. ""Anti-Slavery, Humanitarianism, and Rights"" focuses on the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries to historicize notions of dignity, sympathy, and witness. ""Declarations as a Human Rights Genre"" examines revolutionary eighteenth-century rights declarations in France, the United States, and Haiti against the aspirations of the 1948 UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.",Autumn,SOSC 24900,,"B. Laurence, A. Wang, Staff"
HMRT 10200,Human Rights in World Civilizations II. 100 Units.,"Four thematic clusters structure the second quarter. ""Migration, Minorities, and Refugees"" examines minority rights, the evolution of legal norms around refugees, and human trafficking. ""Late Twentieth Century Human Rights Talk"" explores the contestations between rights claims in the political-civil and socio-economic spheres, calls for sexual rights, and cultural representations of human rights abuses. ""Global Justice"" considers forms of international criminal law, transitional justice, and distributive justice. ""Indigenous Rights as Human Rights"" takes up the relatively new domain of the rights of indigenous peoples and how they relate to contemporary human rights practice.",Winter,SOSC 24901,SOSC 24900,"B.

HMRT 20101,"Human Rights, Empire, and Postcolonial Politics. 100 Units.","This class focuses on the history and theory of human rights by considering it as a quintessentially postcolonial political form. Dialoguing with histories of imperialism, we consider how the genealogies of colonial rule intersect and interact with trajectories of political modernity after the formal end of empire. Empirically, the class focuses on the histories and presents of India and South Africa, as exemplary cases of countries that underwent processes of constitutional decolonization. Thus, rights have a foundational place in both polities. What does that mean? How does that create openings for the imaginations and instantiations of socially transformative policies? How does it lead to the endurance of traces and aspects of colonial government? What are the promises and limits of rights as we consider them in such historical and political contexts? In the process, how does our thinking and conceptualization of rights, imperialism and postcolonial political modernity, and the relationship between them, itself come to be at stake?",Spring,,,Kaushik Sunder Rajan
HMRT 20201,Human Rights and Great Power after Total War and Genocide. 100 Units.,"This class focuses on the history and theory of human rights by considering it as a quintessentially postcolonial political form. We consider how genealogies of human rights intersect and interact with trajectories of colonial rule and postcolonial politics. In the process, the question of rights itself comes to be posed afresh. Empirically, the class focuses on the histories and presents of India and South Africa. Both these countries underwent processes of constitutional decolonization. Thus, rights have a foundational place in both postcolonial polities. What does that mean? How does that create openings for the imaginations and instantiations of socially transformative policies? How does it lead to the endurance of traces and aspects of colonial government?

HMRT 20301,"Loot, Empire and the Decolonial: Human Rights and the Politics of Cultural Restitution. 100 Units.","Who owns culture and where do cultural objects belong? This course explores the cultural politics of the growing movement in the global South demanding the return of objects now housed in Western museums that are the legacies of looting and the illicit trafficking of cultural heritage under 19th and 20th century imperial regimes. We will examine the larger historical, human rights and ethical issues underlying movements for cultural restitution by examining critical cases involving African, Greek and Cambodian cultural heritage looted during the colonial era and now housed at the Musée du Quai Branly and Musée Guimet in Paris, the British Museum in London and the Humboldt Forum in Berlin. Along with classroom readings and discussion, we will meet curators, policymakers, scholars and activists who are actively involved in the contemporary politics of cultural restitution. Museum visits in Paris will be supplemented a short field trip to London (and perhaps Berlin) to better appreciate the transnational dimensions of movements for repatriating cultural heritage.",Spring,,,Mark Bradley

It discusses the emergence of a modern ""human rights"" culture as a product of the formation and expansion of the system of nation-states and the concurrent rise of value-driven social mobilizations. It proceeds to discuss human rights in two prevailing modalities. First, it explores rights as protection of the body and personhood and the modern, Western notion of individualism. Second, it inquires into rights as they affect groups (e.g., ethnicities and, potentially, transnational corporations) or states.",Autumn,"INRE 31700, HIST 29302, HMRT 30200, HIST 39302, CRES 29302",,"Savitri Kunze, Pozen Center for Human Rights Social Science Teaching Fellow"
HMRT 20401,"Speaking Law to ""War"" 100 Units.","What are the key legal principles that govern the conduct of war and protect human rights? The concept of Speaking Law to War addresses the interface and perhaps even more, struggle, disguise and tension between law and power. This course will examine doctrines on the rightfulness of waging war, on who can declare war, and on the manner in which it is to be waged as these relate to contemporary norms and debates within international law.",Spring,,,Kathleen Cavanaugh
HMRT 21006,International Human Rights Law. 100 Units.,"This class is an introduction to international human rights law. It will cover the main international human rights instruments (treaties, conventions, declarations, and the opinions of international courts and human rights bodies) and institutions that operate at the international level. The course will also cover the conceptual foundations of international human rights law, the organization and structure of the United Nations human rights system and regional human rights bodies. The interaction between national and international systems and their cooperation in enforcing international human rights law will also be covered. Finally, we will discuss a couple of countries, including Afghanistan under the Taliban, as case studies to highlight the challenges that face international human rights law in the contemporary world. There are no preconditions for taking this course.",Spring,LLSO 21005,,Staff
HMRT 21007,The Politics of Human Rights Law. 100 Units.,"In contrast to the notion that international law is a 'stable set of normative demands opposed to international politics,' it is 'better understood as an aspect of hegemonic contestation, a technique of articulating political claims in terms of legal rights and duties' (Koskenniemi 2004:197). As a hegemonic technique, law is a surface over which political struggles are waged, reflecting back the political uncertainties of the time. That international law is situated within, not apart from political realities is not in question and before we can begin to explain universal international law, we must first clarify 'what or whose view of international law is meant' (199). This course challenges a traditional reading of international law by examining the politics of law. Specific attention will be paid to the interface between emergency powers and international law. When are international law principles relevant? What guidance or constraints does international law impose on emergency powers? What is the relationship between national and international control mechanisms? How do international law mechanisms supervise or monitor the exercise of emergency powers-from the ""global war on terror"" to Covid19-- and how effective are they? The course will provide students with a toolkit to [re]conceptualise international law in order to better understand the hegemonic contestation over the rights-based discourse.",Autumn,,,"Kathleen Cavanaugh, Senior Lecturer, Pozen Center for Human Rights"
HMRT 21008,Policing Life. 100 Units.,"Policing Life This course explores the historical and contemporary uses of police forces by various states to control and criminalize racialized populations, minority groups, and social movements in diverse geographical regions. By examining multiple histories of violence, occupation, and domination by police forces, students will delve into societal challenges that continue to affect everyday life. The course will also examine how the deployment of police forces, as part of a wave of punitive approaches that have gained popularity in many democratic nations in recent years, disrupts the social fabric of societies, establishes hierarchies, reinforces inequality, and facilitates the criminalization of dissent.",Autumn,,,Maria Aguilar Velasquez
HMRT 21400,Health and Human Rights. 100 Units.,"This course attempts to define health and health care in the context of human rights theory and practice. Does a ""right to health"" include a ""right to health care""? We delineate health care financing in the United States and compare these systems with those of other nations. We explore specific issues of health and medical practice as they interface in areas of global conflict: torture, landmines, and poverty. Readings and discussions explore social determinants of health: housing, educational institutions, employment, and the fraying of social safety nets. We study vulnerable populations: foster children, refugees, and the mentally ill. Lastly, does a right to health include a right to pharmaceuticals? What does the big business of drug research and marketing mean for our own country and the world?",Winter,"MEDC 60405, HLTH 21400, HMRT 31400",,"R. Sherer, E. Lyon"
HMRT 21499,Philosophy and Philanthropy. 100 Units.,"Perhaps it is better to give than to receive, but exactly how much giving ought one to engage in and to whom or what? Recent ethical and philosophical developments such as the effective altruism movement suggest that relatively affluent individuals are ethically bound to donate a very large percentage of their resources to worthy causes-for example, saving as many lives as they possibly can, wherever in the world those lives may be. And charitable giving or philanthropy is not only a matter of individual giving, but also of giving by foundations, corporations, non-profits, non-governmental and various governmental agencies, and other organizational entities that play a very significant role in the modern world. How, for example, does an institution like the University of Chicago engage in and justify its philanthropic activities? Can one generalize about the various rationales for philanthropy, whether individual or institutional? Why do individuals or organizations engage in philanthropy, and do they do so well or badly, for good reasons, bad reasons, or no coherent reasons? This course will afford a broad, critical philosophical and historical overview of philanthropy, examining its various contexts and justifications, and contrasting charitable giving with other ethical demands, particularly the demands of justice. How do charity and justice relate to each other? Would charity even be needed in a fully just world? (A)",Winter,"PHIL 21499, PLSC 21499, MAPH 31499",,Bart Schultz
HMRT 21648,"Languages of Migration: Literature, Law, and Language Justice. 100 Units.","For decades, human rights activists and lawmakers in the United States have been fighting for a person's right to speak their native language before the law, implying that language justice could be achieved through the use of interpreters. At the same time, a new generation of poets and fiction writers has been exercising alternative approaches to language justice, shifting the focus from speakers to listeners, and from the legal to the personal. This course brings these seemingly separate discourses into conversation in an attempt to trace the assumptions that undergird different formulations of language justice in the late 20th century and 21st century. Drawing on Edward Said's The Public Role of Writers and Intellectuals, we will examine NGO statements and immigration court hearings side by side with poetry and fiction by Monica de la Torre, Antonio Ruiz Camacho, Irena Klepfisz, Joseph Brodsky and others. As we analyze theories of identity, desire, language and responsibility and engage with thinkers such as Andrea Long Chu, Hannah Arendt and Aamir Mufti, we will consider the potential implications of bringing literature and law into conversation with one another.",Spring,"CMLT 21648, ENGL 21648",,Yael Flusser
HMRT 21899,The Politics of International Migration. 100 Units.,"This course examines the legal and political dimensions of the phenomenon of international migration: when migrants cross territorial borders and enter a state to whose citizenry they do not belong. During the first half of the course, we will ask why and how migrants move - studying theoretical explanations for population flows - and why and how receiving states try either to attract them or to keep them out. We will reflect on the intersection of inequality and migration by critically examining how different groups of people on the move are categorized in different ways (e.g., as high or low-skilled workers, refugees, ""illegal"" immigrants, asylum-seekers) and, as a consequence, are granted different levels of territorial access and rights. We will also reflect on the human costs of policies of migration control and engage with normative debates on the ethics of borders. During the second half of the course, we will examine what happens to immigrants once they have arrived in the country of reception. Focusing on the cases of undocumented immigrants, asylum-seekers, unaccompanied children, humanitarian claimants, and families, we will ask how different groups claim rights and legal status in the host country and what challenges they encounter in the process. The class readings and lectures will mainly focus on migration to the US and Europe, but we will also briefly touch on immigration to developing countries in the Global South, which host 85% of the world's refugees.",Spring,"SOCI 20587, LLSO 29899, CHDV 21899, ANTH 21899",,C.

HMRT 22040,Religion in Israeli-Palestinian Conflict and Peacemaking. 100 Units.,"The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is arguably the most intractable political conflict at present. The conflict has been subjected to various historiographies and narrative explorations, offering often-competing explanations in an attempt to understand its origin and evolvement, and also the failure of its resolution. This course explores the role of religion in the historical development of the conflict and in its contemporary manifestation, while at the same time probing the potential role of religion in the resolution of the conflict and outlining the history of attempts for religious peace-making in Israel/Palestine. Combining concrete historical analysis and intellectual history, the course will focus on the Jewish, Muslim and Christian views of the conflict and its potential resolution, relating to such themes as covenant, messianism, political theology, the sanctity of the land and the role of Jerusalem. These concepts and others will be explored against the backdrop of the concrete history of the conflict, focusing initially on the formative period of 1897-1948, pivoting to the 1967 war and its aftermath and concluding with the religionization of politics in recent decades and its far-reaching consequences.",Winter,"RLST 22040, HIST 25900, JWSC 24040, CRES 20240",,David Barak-Gorodetsky
HMRT 22123,"Natural Law in the Hist of Scholastic Political Thought: Aquinas, Vitoria, Suárez, Hooker, Grotius. 100 Units.","The concept of natural law has played a central role in the history of Western political thought, and it has often been deployed in political argumentation at pivotal moments in human history, from the discovery of the New World and the American founding to the Nuremberg trials and the Civil Rights Movement. Though the doctrine has antecedents in Greek and Roman philosophers, including Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics, it received its classic articulation in the writings of the Scholastic thinkers of the Middle Ages and early modern period. In this seminar, we will read key primary source texts in the development of natural law theory in the Scholastic age from five of the Scholastic tradition's seminal thinkers: Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274), Francisco de Vitoria (1483-1546), Francisco Suárez (1548-1617), Richard Hooker (1554-1600), and Hugo Grotius (1583-1645). In reading their works, we will consider the theories of natural law they construct as well as the implications of their respective theories for political debates concerning such questions as Spanish treatment of Native Americans, religious toleration, the foundations of international law, and the origins of political authority. We will also consider questions of continuity and discontinuity between the authors and the ways in which their works reflect the historical contexts in which they were written. Throughout, we will focus on close reading and careful exegesis of the primary source texts.",,"MDVL 22123, HIST 22123, RLST 27123",,S. Waldorf

HMRT 22703,Crimmigration. 100 Units.,"The intersection of criminal law and immigration law is a growing field of law that is at the forefront of today's immigration debate. This course will explore how the tools of criminal enforcement, from incarceration to militarized policing have come to dominate immigration control, and how at the same time criminal laws related to immigration are enforced more like civil laws. Among the topics that will be explored in detail are: immigration deterrence through incarceration, deportation as a tool of crime prevention, the immigration consequences of crimes, and the relationship between mass incarceration and immigration detention.",Spring,HMRT 32703,,Pedro Gerson
HMRT 22704,Transitional Justice During Conflict and Peace. 100 Units.,"Transitional justice is an interdisciplinary field of research and practice that explores how societies can recover from systemic violence. The theories and mechanisms of transitional justice have been used to promote democratization, peacebuilding, reconciliation, and the rule of law in societies around the world for more than four decades. The first part of this course asks how we should understand the objectives that transitional justice seeks to achieve? How should cross-cutting principles relating to inclusivity, local ownership, and victim-centredness underpin transitional justice work? The second part of the course therefore examines the specificities and challenges that arise in advancing transitional justice during conflict, within peace negotiations, or as part of post-peace agreement peacebuilding. The third part of the course examines these themes through case studies of Northern Ireland, Sierra Leone, and Ukraine.",Spring,,,"Louise Mallinder, Pozen Visiting Professor"
HMRT 22705,Contemporary Challenges to Freedom of Expression. 100 Units.,"Laws, policies and practices in a range of countries -- and in select regional and international bodies -- threaten to further erode the already fragile right to freedom of expression under both international and domestic law. States' violations of the right have also produced a ""chilling effect"" that has created fear and uncertainty about what is protected speech, further undermining people's ability to harness various forms of expression as a means of dissent and/or protest. This survey course will be case heavy, using examples from select countries with a particular focus on developments over the last decade in North America and Europe. Topics to be addressed include the crackdown on expression in various protest movements, including the racial justice, austerity, BDS, climate justice and Palestine solidarity movements; the increasing use of national security justifications for restricting expression (""glorification""/""apology"" of terrorism); big tech and online censorship; media freedom, including the case of Julian Assange; the growth in SLAPP (strategic lawsuit against public participation) and other lawsuits against journalists/media workers/nongovernmental actors; infringements on cultural and artistic forms expression; academic freedom, including the ""cancellation"" of specific voices within the academy; and the weaponization of freedom of expression by violent far right groups.",Spring,,,"Dasgupta, Ishani"

How do they shift, befuddle and defy the authority of the State? Often, our focus is centered on the how those in power practice statecraft. This course shifts the lens to the margins, exploring how communities on the periphery engage in alternative ""world-makings"" that transcend the constraints of the nation-state. Through this course, we will interrogate global and imperial designs through the lives of those inhabiting wastelands, occupied/contested territories, and war-torn regions. Starting with the rise of the modern nation-state as inheritors of colonial legacies, and tracing its evolution under the neoliberal regime, this course will reveal the various frailties woven into the state structure that are exposed through these contestations. Students will engage with the revolutionary vocabularies and vernacular politics of marginalized groups as they assert their claims to land, rights, and community. By engaging with the transformative actions and narratives from the peripheries, students will gain a deeper understanding of how these communities navigate and reconfigure power dynamics beyond the reach of the state.",Spring,,,"Dasgupta, Ishani"

The World Bank's 2024 Poverty, Prosperity and Planet Report refers to a 'polycrisis' - multiple and interconnected crises occurring simultaneously - that has stalled or reversed the forces of globalization slowed human development, amplified the dilemmas of 'fragile and conflicted states' and unleashed powerful forces of dispossession condemning millions to lives of radical precarity. This course will focus on a set of problems associated with the contemporary political economy of basic resources - land, forests, food, energy, minerals, water, marine resources, shelter - and 'provisioning systems' from the particular vantage point of social justice and human rights, drawing upon case studies from Latin America, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa in particular. This course seeks to understand the sorts of conflicts and struggles over resources and extractive economies in postcolonial settings placed on a wider canvas of transnational capital flows, multi-lateral development institutions, neoliberal state policies, authoritarian populisms, NGOs and social movements. Connections will be made between resources politics in the Global South and the Global North.",Winter,HMRT 33401,,Michael J. Watts
HMRT 23419,Embodying Method: How Artists Catalyze and Sustain Knowledge. 100 Units.,"Artistic intention is often driven by local landscapes of increasing social fragility, where the urgency to mine the past, to excavate historical reason, is paramount to sustaining conversations surrounding issues of sovereignty, religious freedom, Indigenous worlding, race, spiritual affinities, environmental justice and so much more. But alas, such intention is often thwarted by political, cultural, ideological fear and State regulation that artists must be resilient sleuths in engineering solutions to such limits. How do they do this? How do they cope? What do they build? This course is a once-a-week deep dive into artistic practices predominantly speaking to the contexts of the Global South, whose 'work' extends beyond the presumed final exhibited art object, where artists are also activist, teacher, historian, archivist, spiritual leader, social worker and more. Via group discussion, relevant textual reading concerning various artistic projects will be shared (their moving images, socially-engaged projects, historical monuments, map-making and more), at times with the online presence of particular artists under study. 'Embodying Method' is conceived from over two decades of my living and working in Communist contexts, in addition to my commitment to working with artists across the Global South who are dedicated to innovating the social memory of their political realities.",Spring,HMRT 33419,,"Zoe Butt, Pozen Center for Human Rights Visiting Professor"
HMRT 23245,Imagining Human Rights in American Journalism. 100 Units.,"From the anti-slavery press through the New Journalists, every movement in American reporting has imagined human rights in a distinctive way. Some of those imaginaries have persisted and grown hegemonic, while others now languish in the archive-the old radical newspapers forgotten and unread. This course is dedicated to investigating the history of American journalism to see how the press and human rights coevolved: piecing together historical links between movements, recovering lost possibilities, and looking for future paths of development. Following a line from the abolitionists through the international movement against the Belgian Congo and onto contemporary New Yorker-style journalism, we will learn the history of the news in America. Through that history, we will see how developments in journalism-in content, form, and technology-ultimately changed international ideas of human rights.",Spring,,,Matthew Zipf
HMRT 23301,Narratives of Incarceration and Justice. 100 Units.,"This is a community-engaged course which brings enrolled UChicago students and community members together for a quarter of learning, dialogue and knowledge building. We will examine and analyze narratives of incarceration and justice in multiple mediums (history, memoir, film, visual art, storytelling) to explore how narratives of incarceration and justice are documented, told and historicized. What are the dangers of a single story and how can dominant narratives be disrupted? What tools and methods can be deployed to surface previously marginalized lived experiences and truths? How have individuals and communities developed platforms to tell their stories and shape new futures?

Second, the course will view human rights from the perspective of affected communities, centering the experiences and critiques of those on the front lines of human rights crises. Through these two lenses, we will study the three most significant contemporary challenges to human rights in the world today: security regimes emerging from the post-9/11 paradigm of the global war on terror; escalating refugee crises; and climate change.",Winter,HMRT 34638,,"Ishani Dasgupa, Assistant Instructional Professor"

HMRT 24725,Humans After Violence. 100 Units.,"What happens to individuals and societies after experiences with violence? This course takes a critical look at scholarship and practitioner efforts to understand and influence those who make and unmake violence and who are implicated in its aftermath. The four units - violence, trauma, subjectivity, and reconciliation - explore and problematize each of these domains of inquiry. Throughout the course, we will draw from both foundational and emerging texts in anthropology and related disciplines as we critically examine the ""re"" in contexts of violence: re-integration of ex-combatants, re-entry of the formerly incarcerated individuals, re-turn of displaced populations, and re-conciliation among war affected peoples. What are the reach and limits of these discourses in contexts of violence and physical and socioeconomic insecurity?

HMRT 24823,International Human Rights Law and Practice. 100 Units.,"This course will introduce students to the legal architecture of international human rights law. Whilst the legal framing of rights emphasizes universality and the common good, its application reflects the historical compromises and political uncertainties of the times. This course will explore the tensions that are produced when politics meets 'the law' and examine the issues, actors, doctrines and practices that make up the human rights project. As human rights law is evolutive, we will look at how the human rights project has changed and evolved in connection to historical movements and post-colonial politics and has developed in order to address state violence, 'terrorism', minority rights, women's rights, gender and sexuality, transitional justice, health, and responsibility to protect, to name but a few. We will draw on case studies, including the United States, in order to examine the complicated role of the state as both perpetrator and protector and promoter of human rights. Students will be encouraged to think critically about the human rights project; how does it confront the underlying issues of injustice and abuse, as well as the inherent conceptual and structural limitations of supranational human rights mechanisms in addressing and providing remedies for the problems facing the world today.",Autumn,"HMRT 34823, PLSC 24823",,"Kathleen Cavanaugh, Executive Director, Senior Lecturer, Pozen Family Center for Human Rights"

Students will become familiar with the human rights challenges facing Hong Kong and the region today. Topics as diverse as labor rights, gender and sexuality, democracy, access to health care and education, and freedom of expression will command our attention. We will also explore the relationship between art, exhibition practices, the media, and human rights. The University of Chicago's new Hong Kong campus will serve as our home base, but much of our time will be spent undertaking short field excursions to speak with human rights actors, journalists, curators, and artists in Hong Kong along with a tentative short trip to southern China. As the capstone of this intensive course, students will create digital, multimedia documentary projects to showcase their engagement with a particular regional or local human rights problem.

HMRT 25270,Humanitarianism: Anthropological Perspectives. 100 Units.,"Humanitarianism has emerged as one of the key principles used by states and non-state agencies to justify or call for interventions in contemporary global crisis situations. From health crises, natural disasters and even political instability, humanitarianism has gained an unprecedented global currency as a language of justice. In the last two decades, anthropologists have shown the complexities of humanitarian interventions and its intended and unintended effects. In this course we trace what humanitarianism means, its moral and ethical underpinnings and what are the consequences of humanitarian action. The course will interrogate some of the philosophical, conceptual underpinnings of the idea and their implications in the real world. We will read a range of ethnographies including refugee rehabilitation in France, military interventions in Iraq, philanthropy in India to understand the ways in which humanitarianism has emerged as a global language of justice. The course will help students understand the problem of humanitarianism at both the global and the local levels and also bridge the gap between the normative and the actual.",This course was offered Autumn 2019,ANTH 25270,,S.

This course will look at the migrant experience in literature, journalism, poetry, film, and art. We will examine anti-immigrant texts as well as celebrations of migration, to see how storytelling shapes migrant destiny.

HMRT 25408,Human Rights in Japanese History. 100 Units.,"This course examines how the modern concept of ""rights"" and ""human rights"" localized in Japan and how different parties in Japan have used the language of human rights in attempts to remake Japan's social, cultural, and legal landscape. We will explore a wide range of topics including the translation of Eurocentric rights talk in East Asia, colonization and decolonization, statelessness and migration, transitional justice and reconciliation, biopolitical rights and bio-citizenship, indigenous rights, and women and gender-specific rights. Throughout the course we pay special attention to the ways in which rights talk and human-rights politics in Japan intertwine with the country's efforts to modernize and build the ""nation within the empire"" and, after its defeat in WWII, to close off its ""long postwar"" and reconcile with its neighbors. This is an introductory course, and no previous knowledge of Japanese history or the international history of human rights is required. However, you should be prepared to read (and watch, browse, and listen to) a wide array of primary and secondary sources that destabilize the most common vocabulary and concepts we take for granted in contemporary human-rights talk such as race, state responsibility, and the very notion of universalism so central to the idea of human rights.",Winter,"EALC 24508, HIST 24508",,K.

We'll begin by examining works by Aristotle, King, Rawls, and Nussbaum, asking what each theorist thinks justice entails and why. Along the way, we'll ask how stated and suppressed understandings of both ""race"" and ""religion"" inform their theories, as well as complicate and challenge them. Then we'll set these theories of justice in conversation with works by Francisco de Vitoria, W.E.B. Du Bois, James Baldwin, Cornel West, Traci C.

To what extent are justice and legitimacy separate ideas? Does legitimacy require justice? Are just states necessarily legitimate? We will critically analyze and normatively assess how different contemporary theories have answered, whether explicitly or implicitly, such questions. The course will focus on five major contemporary theories: liberal-egalitarianism as represented by the work of John Rawls; libertarianism, as represented by the work of Robert Nozick, neo-Lockean theories as represented by the work of John Simmons, neo-republicanism as represented by the work of Philip Pettit, and neo-Kantian theories as represented by the work of Arthur Ripstein.",Autumn,"LLSO 26920, PLSC 36920, PLSC 26920",,C.

What moral authority do existing borders have? What role should the idea of ""the nation"" play in our thinking about immigration? Indeed, what exactly are nations? And is there a compelling case for the exclusion of immigrants that depends on a commitment to preserving a national culture?

Through close readings of the religious history and culture of Chicago over the last century and a half, the course will focus on Black-White racialization in Chicago, interrogating the construction of and contestation over whiteness among Catholics, Protestants, Jews, and new religious movements, as well as tracing the ""spiritual afterlife of slavery"" in Chicago's churches, synagogues, mosques, and other places of worship.

HMRT 28005,Illicit Religion: Contesting Religious Freedom under the Law in Modern America. 100 Units.,"The ""freedom of religion"" is one of the United States' most enduring and celebrated national ideals. And yet, rights of religious belief and practice have been contested consistently throughout the history of the nation, transforming both cultural practices and legal definitions of religion. Can American religion be radically free *and* fundamentally subject to the legal definitions and executive constraints of the state? Or is religious freedom under the law impossible, as some scholars have it? In this course, we will examine historical events, legal principles and academic debates over the meaning of religion's ""free exercise"" in the United States. Three case studies will ground our investigations: the Pueblo Indian dance controversy of the 1920s, the organization of the Church of Scientology in the 1950s and, finally, conflict over property and political rights at Oregon's Rajneeshpuram in the 1980s. Historical and cultural study will be augmented with theory and legal analysis by scholars of American religion and law. The term will end with student presentations on controversial developments in the exercise of religion since 1993's Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), including its enforcement of religious boundaries around drug use, gay marriage and women's reproductive health.

SSAD 21100,How Things Get Done in Cities and Why. 100 Units.,"Innovation. Prosperity. Democracy. Diversity. Cities long have been lauded as unique incubators of these social features. In contrast to the national level, the smaller scale and dense diversity of cities is thought to encourage the development of civic solutions that work for the many. But cities are inhabited by distinct groups of people with divergent interests and varied beliefs about how to address countless urban issues, such as creating jobs, delivering education, ensuring safe neighborhoods, promoting environmental sustainability, and taking care of the vulnerable. Many groups and organizations have an interest in the outcomes of these processes. Some take action to try to shape them to their own advantage, while others have few chances to make themselves heard. This course examines the social and political dynamics that undergird possible avenues for creating social change in cities, including interest representation, decision-making, and inclusion/exclusion. We will draw insights from multiple disciplines and explore a variety of substantive areas, such as housing, public safety, economic development, education, and the provision of social welfare.

Throughout our work together, we will examine how social class, race/ethnicity, and gender are represented in literacy, language, and cultural theories and research that examine reproduction and resistance. Using cultural studies as the point of departure, this course explores the intersection of culture, power, and language (both oral and written) within schools and school systems. In accordance with the tenets of cultural studies, the course is guided by the presumption that culture (as it is realized through the functioning of schools and their agents and the experiences, knowledge, expressions, dispositions, and meaning-making of people of color, women, and low-income or working-class individuals) is critical for understanding and intervening in the reproduction of social and economic inequality. In order to understand the reproduction of inequality we will examine theories and empirical investigations that explore how structures of domination and subordination are reproduced and social difference and inequality are reinscribed through the cultural practices that are reflected in schools. We will also analyze the extent to which the cultural practices and experiences of marginalized individuals simultaneously contribute to the process of reproduction and also affirm the emancipatory possibilities of resistance.",,"EDSO 23412, EDSO 63412, SSAD 63412",,

Given the rise of race-based social movements such as the Immigrant's Rights Movement and the Movement for Black Lives, exploring this form of mobilization, voice and political participation seems especially pertinent to the study of American politics today. Under consideration throughout the quarter will be such questions as: What counts as a social movement? What motivates people to engage in such activity?

SSAD 21200,"Policing, Citizenship, and Inequality in Comparative Perspective. 100 Units.","Police provide an essential service for citizens - security and protection - without which the exercise of all other rights becomes heavily constrained. Police institutions are also the primary entity of the state with which most citizens come into direct contact. In practice, however, governments throughout the Americas (and beyond) have long struggled to organize police institutions such that they address societal demands for security, and that the deployment of coercion against citizens is applied equitably and constrained by law and external accountability. From São Paulo and Johannesburg to Chicago, police forces engage in widespread extrajudicial killings and torture that largely target marginalized sectors of society, including Afro-descendants, the poor, and those living in the urban periphery. At the same time, these groups are also underserved by their police, leaving them vulnerable to high rates of criminal violence. Through comparative analysis of police institutions in Latin America, the United States, and other regions, this course probes the ways in which police institutions shape the lived experiences of individuals and how police may help reproduce existing social inequalities.",,HMRT 21201,,

We will explore how sociocultural processes shape the experience of distress and mental illness; various cultures of healing, including Western psychiatry, and their power dynamics; gaps and inequalities in service provision; as well as approaches to and challenges of cross-cultural diagnosis/treatment/epidemiology. Building on these explorations, we will then turn to the tools, programs, and practices that constitute the somewhat amorphous movement called ""Global Mental Health."" Ongoing debates of this movement will also be examined.

The debates as well impact who will be welcomed to migrate in the future and under what conditions. This course will start with a historical perspective and then take a deeper look at the ways in which our laws and accompanying systems shape the everyday lives of undocumented individuals and mixed-status families. We will look into the realities and consequences affecting multiple immigrant communities and cultures in the U.S. We will delve into the U.S. immigration policy debates and alternative visions. We'll consider how states and the federal government interface, collaborate and clash. As immigration, immigrants and refugees are today a central focus of U.S. politics and affected by these realities, we will explore related current and future political dynamics, advocacy, research and social movements upon the directions of immigration policies.

Historically the U.S. has been the largest resettlement country, and in the U.S. refugees are entitled to federal, state, and local supports that other immigrants do without. At the same time, refugees in the U.S. are arguably subject to greater scrutiny and social control than most other un-incarcerated domestic populations. This course asks the central questions: How is refugee status politically constructed and experienced by individuals; what are the interrelationships between institutional actors and refugee policies, with what implications for service delivery; what does research tell us about the resettlement outcomes. and what drives these outcomes; and finally, what are the points of intervention for social workers in the resettlement process? We will address these questions by: 1. detangling the web of international and domestic policies that relate to the refugees' political identity, 2. focusing on U.S. resettlement, 3. analyzing resettlement policies and exploring the implications for social work practice targeted at integration, employment, and mental health, and 4. holding the inherent tension that can result from a dual focus on macro issues of scale and policy and micro issues related to the lived experience of human beings.",,"CHST 26922, RDIN 26922, SSAD 46922, CRES 26922, HMRT 46922",,

In this course, we will explore the paradox of how so many people struggle to afford an adequate diet within the borders of the world's top food exporter and the extent to which inequality is embedded in the U.S. food system and in American social policy. We will examine the basic structure of our domestic food system, the causes and consequences of food insecurity, the effectiveness of current public and private responses, and how new challenges in the 21st century may influence current and future strategies. Among the diverse topics we will delve into over the quarter are the recent efforts to reduce access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which remains the primary mechanism for addressing food insecurity; the economic challenges experienced by workers throughout the food system, from farm to table; the intersection of the U.S. food system and immigration; the significant disparities in food insecurity and diet-related illness experienced by communities of color; and emerging ideas for how to establish a more equitable food system.",,SSAD 40550,,

Evidence indicates that mass incarceration has reached a tipping point, and that the U.S. is entering an era of decarceration. The grand challenge of this new era will be to move away from incarceration-based thinking and toward an array of proactive policy, practice, and research innovations that will not only substantially reduce the incarcerated population, but also ameliorate social disparities and maximize public safety and well-being. This course, which is connected to the ""Promote Smart Decarceration"" Grand Challenge for Social Work, will provide opportunities for students to: 1) Explore the political, social, and empirical context for decarceration; 2) Examine emerging decarceration policies and practices; 3) Develop interventions at multiple levels to achieve smart decarceration outcomes.",,SSAD 47452,,

People seem to have always been concerned with fitting in, but the way of describing the general run of practices and conditions as ""normal"" is a rather recent phenomenon; testament to the vast influence of the modern human sciences on how we understand ourselves and others. This research seminar will offer a broad historical overview of the ways that group behaviors and individual traits - bodily, moral, intellectual - were methodically described and measured in the past 200 years. We will become acquainted with the work of sociologists and anthropologists, psychiatrists and psychologists, polling experts and child development specialists, and ask about the kinds of people their efforts brought into being, from sexual perverts to the chronically depressed. The course will focus on the scientific theories and techniques used to distinguish the normal from the pathological, together with the new social institutions that translated this knowledge into forms of control.

We will explore these questions together with a set of methodological concerns around how to study, represent, and memorialize the Holocaust and other historical atrocities, asking: is the Holocaust best approached as a unique historical event or should it be studied together with the histories of enslavement, imperialism, and colonialism? Is there something about the very nature of modernity that generates fascism? What stories can be told, how should they be told, and who has the right to tell them?

JWSC 26620,Tradition and Modernity in Jewish Thought and Literature. 100 Units.,"The concept of tradition often takes a back seat to modernity but what does it mean to be part of a tradition in the modern world? How does tradition challenge received views and stimulate creativity, against the modern view of tradition as the ""dead hand of the past""? How have the concept; ideology; and cultural role of tradition changed in Jewish culture since the Enlightenment? This course explores those questions in three bodies of work: (1) late 18th- to mid-20th-century German-Jewish historians, critics, & theologians; (2) modern Hebrew & Yiddish writers; and (3) their shared biblical, rabbinic, and mystical inspirations. Through close readings of these writers' reflections on their own literary traditions, tradition emerges as both a resource and a problem for Jewish cultural creativity; one that calls for its own theoretical vocabulary and can be set in dialogue with the modern evolution of other traditional cultures.",Winter,"RLST 26620, HIJD 36620",,James A.

In this course, we examine how the Bible and other ancient texts portray human catastrophe and the possibility of new beginnings. From national upheavals and the dawn of a final political order, down to the fate of the individual and the destiny of the cosmos at large, this course exposes students to the multiplicity of ways that the End is envisioned throughout the Bible and later interpretation. How do biblical authors interpret the meaning of existence in light of the End? What stands out about ancient literature when we understand it as anticipating the End, and how can these texts help us understand contemporary fears about the End?

Next, we will explore the lives of individual Africans and their American descendants, the communities they built, and the cultures they created. We will consider the diversity of the Black Atlantic by examining the lives of a broad array of individuals, including black intellectuals, statesmen, soldiers, religious leaders, healers, and rebels. We will examine African diasporic subjects as creative rather than reactive historical agents and their unique contributions to Atlantic cultures, societies, and ideas. Within this geographically and temporally expansive history students will explore a key set of animating questions: What is the Black Atlantic? How can we understand both the commonalities and diversity of the experiences of Africans in the Diaspora? What kinds of communities, affinities, and identities did Africans create after being uprooted by the slave trade? What methods do scholars use to understand this history?

This course delves into the history of these issues in the region. In the process, it sheds light on broader themes of Latin American history from the late colonial period to the present day. As the course shows through topics ranging from crimes against honor, to the policing of street vending, to the drug war, crime and policing in Latin America have been crucial spaces for the construction and contestation of social and legal hierarchies, the voicing of political protest and social critique, and the making and unmaking of citizenship. Through the use of diverse readings, including primary sources such as court records, satirical poems, and blockbuster films, students will trace how ideas of crime, and of the role of the state in attempting to define it and respond to it, changed over time with broader social, economic, and political developments. In doing so, they will examine how crime and policing have intersected with class, race, and gender, and how debates over crime and the practices of policing have shaped the boundaries of citizenship.",Spring,"RDIN 16404, HIST 16404, GNSE 16404",,K.

A feature film? Street photography or aerial views? Does the urban experience itself give shape to certain narratives or styles? This course will examine portrayals of Mexico City in literature, film, and photography since the 1950s, in order to attempt some answers. Just like Paris or New York, Mexico City has inspired generations of authors who have tried their hand at representing this 500-year-old city of roughly 22 million people. We will trace the city's modern transformations through those cultural products that aim to build an image of the place. How do these artworks shape (or contest) the collective imagination of the city? By examining representations of this Latin American capital, we will articulate questions regarding inequality, overpopulation, modernization, and the foreign gaze. In addition to cultivating critical and historical perspectives on the urban experience, we will also engage creatively with the city that surrounds us, Chicago. Works to be discussed may include the likes of Roberto Bolaño, Carlos Monsiváis, Alfonso Cuarón, Valeria Luiselli, and Juan Villoro, among others.

From the revolutions and dictatorships of the 1960s-70s, through the transitions to democracy, to the queer and feminist movements of the early 21st century, we will study contemporary adaptations of canonical authors such as Cervantes, Lope de Vega, and Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz. The position of these authors, texts, and characters in the literary canons of the Americas has allowed them to achieve circulation in both ""high"" and ""low"" culture, through modes of performance including film and television, live theater and dance, opera, popular music, drag, burlesque, and digital media. From the US-Mexico borderlands to the Southern Cone, these adaptations raise questions of national and postcolonial identity, gender and sexuality, and collective trauma and memory. We will use the theoretical frameworks of performance, decoloniality, and canonicity to think of adaptive performances as an act of deconstruction and remaking, and to trace how artists in the Americas respond to these historical legacies through embodied practice.

Using the 1950s as a starting point, when the establishment of the constitution of Puerto Rico in 1952 and the success of the Cuban revolution in 1959 brought new models for state-sponsored experimental cinema, we will see movies that mix documentary and fiction in a manner that the aesthetics of film language are used as an expression of a collective political subjectivity. The relationship between Latin America and the United States will be crucial for this analysis because it points to the colonial/postcolonial context of the fight against imperialism that is manifest in these movies. In this regard, we will see cinema related to the processes of resistance during and after the dictatorships in Argentina, Brazil and Chile, and the ways the precarious economies of Colombia, Perú and Puerto Rico required the development of new ways of cinematographic self-representation at the turn of the 21st century. The emphasis will be on experimental film, focusing on their guerilla production strategies and the aesthetic innovations that are explored in these movies. Some of the filmmakers we will discuss are Raúl Ruiz (Chile), Luis Ospina (Colombia), Santiago Álvarez (Cuba), Amílcar Tirado (Puerto Rico), Gianfranco Annichini (Perú), Albertina Carri (Argentina) and Eduardo Coutinho (Brazil); among others.",Spring,SPAN 23525,,Jean Vallejo González

Although Marx is most widely known for his arguments about political economy and revolution, his earliest scholarly energies were devoted to jurisprudence and throughout his life he frequently returned to questions about the law's nature, possibilities, and limits. He did so not only in his analyses of the modern state and capitalism, but also in his efforts to document the goals, victories, and setbacks of democratic movements, labor unions, and political radicals as they navigated repressive legal systems, fought for legal reforms, and developed alternative visions of how to regulate social life.

LLSO 28091,The Origin and Development of Political Psychology: From Plato to Martha Nussbaum. 100 Units.,"The course is devoted to the examination of the origin and development of political psychology, namely the application to politics of the study of the human mind. We will start with Plato's notion of the tripartite soul, devised to overcome the problems in the theory of action left open by Socrates, and to support an aristocratic arrangement of society; we will examine Aristotle's bipartite soul and its notion of weakness of the will. We will then move on to the 19th century and examine the pathbreaking work of Gustave le Bon on the psychology of crowds, which is the first attempt at studying the collective behavior of people in a situation of crowd; then Freud's application of his theory of the psyche to collective behavior, and more specifically to two established crowds -the Church and the army. Finally, we will examine some contemporary authors: Rawls' image of man as a free, rational being; Hampshire's reprise of the notion of 'parts of the soul' and his criticism of Plato; we will conclude with the role of emotions in Martha Nussbaum's thought. The first two classes will be devoted to a clarification of the notion of 'political philosophy' and to an account of the methodology in the history of political thought.",Autumn,,,Giovanni Giorgini
LLSO 29020,Resistance in Theory and Practice. 100 Units.,"Guerrillas, liberators, and oppressed groups of all kinds have appealed to resistance as an organizational strategy, political theory, and moral justification. Resistance is violent or non-violent, active or passive, individual or collective, bodily or intellectual. Often it involves breaking the law. This course explores the diverse histories of resistance in the modern world. Readings include H. D. Thoreau's essay on civil disobedience; Angela Davis's lectures on liberation; Rosa Luxemburg's pamphlet on the mass strike; Frantz Fanon's defense of anticolonial violence; Hannah Arendt's critique of student violence; and Audre Lorde's theses on intersectional feminist resistance. To provide context, we will discuss the international labor movement; decolonization; and the contemporary politics of Black Lives Matter, Standing Rock, Antifa, and climate protest. Together we will test at least one hypothesis: To resist means to manipulate a regime of oppression, to subvert it from within, but never entirely to escape it.",Winter,HIST 28306,,Terence Renaud
LLSO 29065,Early Theories of Capitalism. 100 Units.,"The ""Theories of Capitalism"" sequence introduces students to classic texts in the history of economic thought. Students may take just one of the two courses: Early Theories of Capitalism or Twentieth-Century Theories of Capitalism. Enrollment in both is strongly encouraged but not required. Across the two courses, we examine diverse accounts of the forces that govern capitalist societies and the distinctive problems that emerge within them. As we do this, we also look closely at how the economists who developed these theories demarcated the economic domain of human life and we consider how their efforts to understand it were shaped by a rich body of intellectual resources. Early Theories of Capitalism focuses on the theoretical and practical concerns that animated economic writing in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Among these are questions about the origins of wealth and value, the effect of machines on the production process, the role of the state in economic life, and the condition and fate of the working class. Readings may include texts by Adam Smith, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, Carl Menger, and Alfred Marshall.",Winter,PLSC 23065,,Sarah Johnson

LLSO 29706,Race Law. 100 Units.,"Race Law takes the law of race as a distinct body of study. It examines how statutes, cases, and other legal materials create racial categories, and how the legal definitions of race are used to reinforce and establish social hierarchies and to exclude certain categories of persons from full rights-bearing legal personhood. This class explores legal cases and primary sources from colonial America to the present to map out the legal construction of race over time. Although incorporating non-legal sources to highlight that the law is not a ""black box"", the class focuses on the role of law in crafting our understanding of what race means.

LLSO 29708,Neoliberalism and its Critics. 100 Units.,"In recent years, ""neoliberalism"" has been increasingly adopted as a catchall explanatory framework (and often also critical epithet) naming an ensemble of ideologies, political economic structures, and governance practices that have arguably been hegemonic since the late twentieth century. Despite contestation about its meaning-and even its existence-interested scholars have frequently associated neoliberalism with economic phenomena like financialization, the asset economy, globalization, and deregulation as well as political and social transformations including novel state-market relations, the extension of the market logic across society, and the production of economically rational subjects. In this seminar, we will examine neoliberalism as theorized by both proponents and critics; neoliberalism as a collection of economic, political, social, and cultural practices and institutions; and the neoliberal era as a historical period of innovations, transformations, developments, crises, and events. Our survey of neoliberal theories, practices, effects, and possibilities will cross disciplinary boundaries and draw from fields such as economics, political science, sociology, law, history, and anthropology. Reading in this course will include classical statements of neoliberal thought, major analyses of neoliberalism from both historical and theoretical perspectives, and new critical scholarship.",Autumn,,,

The course is organized thematically and will begin by introducing the field of comparative constitutional studies and exploring the different ends constitutions may serve in different political contexts. It will then examine the ways in which constitutional design can help or hinder a society's project of establishing democratic government, promoting political stability, and protecting fundamental rights. From there, the course will proceed to examining institutional arrangements from a comparative perspective to understand how features of institutional design have a bearing on the political system and its democratic performance. Besides covering influential jurisdiction like the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and South Africa, we will draw our examples from jurisdictions that have traditionally been overlooked in comparative constitutional law including countries as diverse as Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Myanmar, Colombia, Argentina, Chile, and others.

LING 10150,Language and Conflict. 100 Units.,"An aphorism commonly thrown around, and then hastily disregarded, in linguistics courses is ""A language is a dialect with an army and a navy,"" popularized by sociolinguist Max Weinreich. While this definition may not hold water when it comes to analyzing the structures or validity of the world's languages, language and language ideology have played an important, but under-emphasized, role in colonial and nationalist power and policy. From early the early violence of linguistic imperialism to later attempts at creating ethnolinguistically unified nations during decolonization to post-colonial reconfigurations of global languages, this course will examine the varied roles language, language analysis, and language policy have played in cultural and political conflicts.

LING 22460,Seminar: Phonology. 100 Units.,"Seminar on Sound Change. One of the great mysteries of linguistics is the so-called actuation problem (Weinreich, Labov, and Herzog 1968), that is, what causes the inception of language change, if the linguistic conditions favoring particular changes are always present? Recent work has drawn on interspeaker variation for a solution to the actuation puzzle. The main impetus for considering individual differences in the context of sound change comes from the need to build a linking theory that bridges the gap between the emergence of new linguistic variants and their eventual propagation. This seminar will explore sources of individual linguistic differences, and the role they may play in the initiation and propagation of sound change. By ""individual differences"", we refer to those psychological, sociological, genetic and/or behavioral differences between the individuals who make up a speech community at the levels of production, perception and cognitive representation. Some questions we will consider in detail at this seminar include: How do individual differences affect variation? How do they affect the initiation, phonologization, and propagation of changes?

These include not only Spanish and European Portuguese, the dominant languages in Spain and Portugal, respectively, but also minoritized languages such as Galician, Basque, Catalan, and others. This class will investigate the morphosyntax of minoritized Iberian languages, drawing comparisons with the dominant languages in the area (Spanish, Portuguese, and French), which have exerted enormous influence on the minoritized languages due to centuries of contact. The focus will be the morphosyntax of these languages, but we also aim to better understand the complex social, historical, and political forces that have shaped them, as well as the way they continue to be affected by these forces and their long and sometimes fraught relationship with the dominant languages.",Winter,,,"Karlos Arregi, Naomi Kurtz"

Have you wondered how exactly are different pieces of language used in different kinds of music? Are there rules and limitations? In this class we are going to take a tour through a wide array of linguistic and musical traditions in order to try and answer that question. Some of the topics that we will explore together include: tones and melody, prosody and rhythm, linguistic register and musical genre, the distributions of vocables, and tastes of more advance topics such as melisma, polyrhythm, historical pronunciations and different 'classical' musics around the world. We will also learn to present on unfamiliar musical and linguistic topics and develop a general appreciation of the unique languages and musical traditions from diverse socioeconomic, geographic and historical backgrounds.

We will explore how and why languages are constructed, critically assess the design of existing conlangs (e.g. Klingon, Esperanto), and discuss conlanging both as an art form and as a tool to study the properties of natural human language, connecting this to the field of linguistic typology. Throughout the course, students will each build their own conlang, combining knowledge across various linguistic subfields to produce a workable grammar. They will explore the patterns seen in natural languages, developing a deeper understanding of how phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics interact and applying this towards language construction.",Winter,,,"Gray, Sam."

This course will engage with the literature on contact linguistics and multilingualism providing theoretical backgrounds and foundations for analyzing real-world situations. This course will apply the theoretical understandings to several instances of contact linguistics and a variety of complex social situations via case studies. We will briefly cover topics and process such as: bi/multilingualism, translanguaging, dialect leveling, mixed-Languages, pidgins & creoles, and language shift, all through a lens that addresses the complex situations they exist in with respect to cultural contact and colonialism. This brief overview of each of these processes will give students a basis for understanding and recognizing them in real-world contexts as well as providing them with the tools to ask critical questions about the situations and results.",Winter,,,"Castro, Steven."
LING 29411,Linguistic Introduction to Telugu. 100 Units.,"This course is an overview-style introduction to the Telugu language, including grammar, phonology, and the social, political, and historical contexts of the language and its users. Telugu, the majority language of the two southern Indian states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, is within the top twenty most spoken languages in the world. The global Telugu-speaking diaspora, too, is growing quickly in population and in relevance, especially in the United States. This course primarily aims to give students an introduction to the structure of the language, through learning the script, learning to recognize verbal and nominal morphology, and understanding the role of word order in a Telugu sentence. Students will also learn to use this knowledge as a way to answer questions such as: How is language tied to social categories such as ethnicity, class, caste, and geographical origin? How can the phonetic, morphological, and syntactic features of a language be taken up as markers of identity and as symbols in discourse?",Winter,,,"Aitha, Akshay."
LING 29412,Linguistics of American Sign Language. 100 Units.,"Signed languages offer a unique perspective through which to understand human language and linguistic structure as it is realized across modalities (spoken vs. signed). Although signed languages offer crucial linguistic insights, there are many widely held misconceptions about the structure of these languages. In this course, we deconstruct these misconceptions as we study the structure of American Sign Language (ASL). Specifically, we will be looking at how core areas of language are manifest in ASL including the component parts of a sign (phonology), individual signs (morphology), sentence structure (syntax), and meaning (semantics), while also addressing sociolinguistics and language acquisition. Through this exploration, we will consider what the visual modality can teach us about the human language capacity.",Spring,,,Kate Henninger
LING 29413,Structure of Heritage Turkish. 100 Units.,"Modern) Turkish is a heavily agglutinating (suffixing) Turkic language (Altaic) with basic SOV word order (head final) as well as vowel harmony. The total number of L1 and L2 speakers of Turkish is estimated to be more than 90 million, including a large immigrant community residing in mainly Europe. The aim of this course is two-fold: Firstly, we will examine the structural properties of Turkish by way of engaging in linguistic fieldwork with native speakers. This will allow us to improve our analytical thinking and problem solving skills and familiarize us with the workings of a non-Indo-European language. Then, we will focus on the differences between Turkish as spoken in the mainland (Türkiye) and heritage Turkish as spoken by Turkish speaking immigrants in Europe. In doing so, we will investigate the role of socio-economic and political factors in shaping the grammatical and structural properties of languages.",Spring,,,"Eren, Omer."

We will study how others have approached this form, how they have sought to control it, uplift it, analyze it, destroy it, take it seriously, or learn to live with it. This course is both an introduction to the academic field of ""porn studies"" and to its equal and opposite: the endless repository of historical and current attempts to get pornography out of the way, to keep it somewhere else out of sight, to destroy it, or to deem it unworthy of study. We begin with a conversation about what the stakes are and have been in studying porn and how we might go about doing it, and then move through history and media technologies beginning with the category of pornography's invention with regards to drawings from Pompeii. The course is meant to introduce students to various forms pornography has taken, various historical moments in its sociocultural existence, and various themes that have continued to trouble or enchant looking at pornography. The goal of this course is not to make an argument for or against porn wholesale, but to give students the ability to take this contentious form and its continued life seriously, intelligently, and ethically.

MADD 10325,"Setting Sound Standards: Music, Media, and Censorship in South Asia. 100 Units.","This course aims to introduce students to various musical and performance traditions in South Asia and their evolution within regimes of institutional, legal and media censorship. The course aims to understand how media environments and cultures of censorship are in some ways fundamental to shaping performance cultures in South Asia in the twentieth century. How do traditions of musical performance entrenched in the politics of caste, communalism, religion, sexuality and gender interact with regimes of censorship and new media? How do the latter remake and unmake said traditions? Be it the mid-century ban on film music by All India Radio to reflect the aspirations of a newly-emerging nation or the appropriation and urbanization of 'folk' musical practices within the recording studios in Nepal by upper-caste, upper-class male performers- censorship and media infrastructures have been integral to the current ontologies of diverse musical genres in South Asia. Through the analysis of a variety of primary and secondary texts on performance and musical aesthetics, media and music ethnographies, reception and production histories as well as critical listening/viewing exercises, this course seeks to complicate mainstream Euro-American narratives that tend to posit media-modernities as global and uniform. We will seek to understand how South Asian musical cultures and sound practices enter into a creative interplay with musical discourses and media-materialities emerging in the West.",Autumn,"SALC 25325, MUSI 23322, TAPS 20215",,Ronit Ghosh

MADD 10871,"Horror, Abjection, and the Monstrous Feminine. 100 Units.","This course explores cinematic and literary works of horror (the uncanny, gothic, sci-fi, paranormal, psychological thriller, killer/slasher, gore) from around the world. As a mode of speculative fiction, the genre envisions possible or imagined worlds that amplify curiosities, dreads, fears, terrors, phobias, and paranoias which simultaneously repel and attract. Horror frequently explores the boundaries of what it means to be human by dwelling on imaginaries of the non-human and other. It often exploits the markers of difference that preoccupy our psychic, libidinal, and social lifeworlds-such as race, class, gender, and sexuality, but also the fundamental otherness that is other peoples' minds and bodies. Interrogating the genre's tension between desire and fear, our course will focus on the centrality of abjection and the monstrous feminine-as both thematic and aesthetic tropes-to works of horror. Films and fiction will be paired with theoretical readings that contextualize the genre of horror while considering its critical implications in relation to biopolitical and geopolitical forms of power.

MADD 10904,Media Wars. 100 Units.,"Media practices and discourses evoking war or violence are common today, such as the ""weaponization"" of social media; ""cyber warfare"" and attacks; ""online battlefields;"" ""guerilla"" media tactics; ""The Great Meme War"" and ""Infowars.com,"" to name a few. In relationship with terms suggesting that we live in an age of ""post-truth"" dominated by ""fake news"" or ""fact-challenged"" journalism, the media wars of today may seem unique to the twenty-first century. But in fact, the history of the use of media to either combat or spread ideas dates back centuries to the earliest phases of mass media and communication. In this class, we will proceed historically, broadly conceiving of media to include print and visual, cultural, and artistic forms, cinema, television, and the internet. While we will explore how media have historically been used to construct or counter dominant systems of representation, we will also discuss how different media forms function formally, learning to analyze how they construct discourses of truth as texts (documentary; propaganda). This class will also function as a contemporary research laboratory where students will be asked to track, evaluate, and theorize contemporary or historical media that are taking part in a so-called ""media war.""",Spring,"CMST 30904, GNSE 30114, SIGN 26061, CMST 20904, GNSE 20114",,Jennifer Wild
MADD 10940,Reading Reality TV: How to Research Identity in Contemporary Culture. 100 Units.,"This course examines the cultural politics of reality television with a focus on how these wildly successful shows, often perceived as guilty pleasures, have in fact been responsible for mediating important conversations around issues of race, gender, and sexuality. This course is also a survey of reality tv, conceived simultaneously as an artifact and an archive of pop culture and mainstream politics. We will start with the ""first"" reality tv show An American Family, which aired in 1971, and examine the emergence of reality tv from genres of documentary and cinéma vérité (such as Andy Warhol's Chelsea Girls, Grey Gardens, and Candid Camera). We will then analyze the advent of so-called unscripted television of the 1990s and early 2000s with special attention to shows like The Real World, Queer Eye, Laguna Beach: The Real O.C., Judge Judy, and The Apprentice. We will also consider more contemporary shows like Keeping Up with the Kardashians, RuPaul's Drag Race, The Real Housewives, and 90 Day Fiancé. Student interest will factor into our selection. Above all, students will develop practical skills of research and methodology. In addition viewing shows and reading theorists of identity and media, students will craft individual research projects about specific shows throughout the term, culminating in a symposium.

This course examines literary texts from antiquity to today that have been dismissed as smut, pulp, and/or trash in either their contemporary moment or reception, and it asks how we might develop as a class a theory of filth. Syllabus materials will range from Catullus's sparrow poems to Richard Crashaw's excremental poetry to Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre-labeled a ""naughty book""-to contemporary objects such as: the romance novel (incl. the works of Melissa Blue, E.l. James, and Beverly Jenkins); film (John Waters' Trash Trilogy, Mark Robson's Valley of the Dolls); and online fanfiction databases.

The exhibition explores ""pictures within pictures,"" images that reflect on the nature of image-making, across a range of media and genres. A virtual version of the exhibition is available on the Prezi platform, and a physical installation, supported by the Smart Museum, will be installed in the Media Arts Data and Design Center (MADD). Visual materials for the course include paintings and drawings, diagrams, models of the visual process, image ""atlases,"" multi-stable images, cinematic and literary representations of images nested within narratives. The readings for the course will include Michel Foucault on Velasquez's Las Meninas, Walter Benjamin on ""dialectical images,"" C. S. Peirce on iconicity, Nelson Goodman on analog and digital codes, and Georges Didi-Huberman on Aby Warburg's Mnemosyne Bilderatlas. Students will be encouraged to explore traditional examples of metapictures such as the Duck-Rabbit (canonized by Gombrich and Wittgenstein) or to investigate newly emergent forms of self-reflexive media. Guest lectures will be given by Patrick Jagoda on experimental games and Hillary Chute on comics and graphic narrative; these might be coordinated with the Media Aesthetics ore sequence in the fall term, which focuses on the question of the image.",Autumn,"CMST 37505, CMST 27505, ARTH 29992, ARTV 30022, ARTH 39992, ENGL 29992, ARTV 20022, ENGL 49992",This course is by consent only.

Taking this platform as our starting place, this class explores how these terms and their use have been gendered; have situated both gender and sexuality as either weapons of resistance or objects of destruction.

MADD 11314,Fluxus and the Question of Media. 100 Units.,"The course investigates the international Fluxus network of the 1960's and 70's from a media perspective. Often identified with the concept of ""intermedia"" launched in a 1966 text by artist, writer and publisher Dick Higgins, Fluxus artists seemed at pain to distinguish their work from the multimedia or gesamtkunstwerk approaches of the Happening artists, seeking instead to formulate a mode of working between or even beyond media. Underpinned by a desire to pass beyond the work of art itself, this was a complex position that had profound implications for their approaches to technologies and practices such as film, video, computing, sound/music, theatre, poetry and image-making. We will try to map the various facets of this position, with particular emphasis on its relation to another key Fluxus concept: the work as event.",Autumn,"ARTH 21314, ARTH 31314, CMST 37804, CMST 27804",,I.

This course is devoted to an in-depth study of Parreno's work and the highly original form of media thinking that informs it. Rather than focusing on the properties of distinct media or on multimedial forms or presentation, his works explore the new forms of life and social existence that result from the various ways in which 20th- and 21st-century media technologies store, manipulate, and produce time. This is a form of thinking and artistic creation that addresses the realities of formats, programs, and platforms rather than media apparatuses and messages, and that engages everything from architecture and design to social situations, natural worlds, and virtual beings.

While this course will survey the topic of the filming of police from multiple perspectives, it aims to construct a specifically disciplinary framework for research on police violence. Topics to include dashboard and body cameras; surveillance, sousveillance, and the regime of visibility; investigative and citizen journalism; records management and archiving; evidence in court proceedings and in the public sphere; police, media, and ideology; the ethics and politics of looking at black suffering; art about police violence; filming the police in an international frame.",Winter,"CMST 37005, HMRT 27005, HMRT 37005, CMST 27005",,S.Skvirsky

MADD 12351,The Sonic Image. 100 Units.,"The Sonic Image offers a unique opportunity to work with three senior researchers exploring the bridge-making and sense delimiting articulations of sound & sight together. We will examine the potency of sound in a world largely understood through its visualization as a world picture. Readings in sound studies, visual studies & media studies explore sound, sounds that evoke pictures, the forensics of sound, sound art, & films including The Conversation, Blow Out & Amour. Each faculty collaborator brings distinct interests to the course. WJT Mitchell's renowned theorization of images naturally extends to his theorizing the possibility of the sonic image. Artist Lawrence Abu Hamdan's commitment to the value of earwitnessing asks the listener to extend forensic knowledge to the very core of what it means to be a human being in the world. For the course, Hamdan will develop a workshop comprising a series of practical exercises that experiment with the conditions of testimony or claim making, enabling an exploration of how the law come to its truths and how can we use sonic imagination to trouble & contest established modes of enacting justice. Performance scholar, Hannah B Higgins, examines how musical notation, performance & sound bear on the relationships between sound & vision in recent art practices.

This class explores the structure, function, and impact of a range of vernacular musics from the 20th and 21st centuries. Our approach to popular music will be by turns historical, analytical, and sociological. Students will learn about formal designs of pop songs, from verse-chorus to much more elaborate structures, along with antecedents in the Great American Songbook tradition. Students will learn to analyze the harmonic and melodic conventions in various genres, and also spend significant time with groove analysis and design. Finally, the class will interrogate the sociological relevance of vernacular musics, weaving in discussions of relevant social issues from radio play to popularity, and from subcultural appeal to racial identity. This class is open to anyone who listens carefully and with passion, and who wants to grow their ability to write about music.

Critics, designers, and enthusiasts alike refer to their mechanics as ""verbs,"" like Super Mario's JUMP or Minecraft's BUILD. Sometimes, like other kinds of media objects, video games themselves are referred to as ""texts."" Starting from these premises, this course will investigate why it makes sense to use this linguistic vocabulary to describe video games. We will consider what theories of language have to teach us about video games, and what video games have to teach us about language itself and the worlds it reveals to us. Readings will include philosophers of language like Ludwig Wittgenstein and Jacques Derrida, digital media scholars like McKenzie Wark and Bo Ruberg, and literary writers like Jorge Luis Borges and Clarice Lispector. This will be a reading- and writing-heavy course: class meetings will consist of discussion of readings, and assignments will generally take the form of written responses and critical essays. Video games (or recorded video game playthroughs) may be assigned alongside films, video clips, and podcasts at low or no cost to students.

MADD 12800,Theories of Media. 100 Units.,"This course will explore the concept of media and mediation in very broad terms, looking not only at modern technical media and mass media, but at the very idea of a medium as a means of communication, a set of institutional practices, and a habitat in which images proliferate and take on a ""life of their own."" The course will deal as much with ancient as with modern media, with writing, sculpture, and painting as well as television and virtual reality. Readings will include classic texts such as Plato's Allegory of the Cave and Cratylus, Aristotle's Poetics, and modern texts such as Marshall McLuhan's Understanding Media, Regis Debray's Mediology, and Friedrich Kittler's Gramophone, Film, Typewriter. We will explore questions such as the following: What is a medium? What is the relation of technology to media? How do media affect, simulate, and stimulate sensory experiences? What sense can we make of concepts such as the ""unmediated"" or ""immediate""? How do media become intelligible and concrete in the form of ""metapictures"" or exemplary instances, as when a medium reflects on itself (films about films, paintings about painting)? Is there a system of media? How do we tell one medium from another, and how do they become ""mixed"" in hybrid, intermedial formations? We will also look at recent films such as The Matrix and Existenz that project fantasies of a world of total mediation and hyperreality.

MADD 13133,Queering Visual Culture in Modern India. 100 Units.,"This course will examine the process of queering visual cultures in modern India, whereby it interrogates how popular visual cultures (primarily film and advertisements) have upheld normative regimes of gender/sexuality as well as how they have subverted, and 'queered' these regimes. It also asks how expressions of gender and sexuality have been shaped by the contingent and contentious politics of postcolonial India. This course will map three kinds of gender/sexuality visualities in Indian popular culture-ideal woman/femininity, men and masculinities, and queer identity and sexuality. We will pay particular attention to the ways in which films intervene in and shape histories of gendered representation, notably with regard to the figure of the courtesan or 'tawa'if' as mediated through blockbuster films. Similarly, we will look at how specific political and social moments construct particular gendered or sexualized representations. These include: the figure of the ""mother"" during India's nation-building years (1950s); the trope of the ""angry young man"" set against the country's emergency-era politics and massive unemployment (1970s); and the sexualized male hero, as expressed by the superstar Shah Rukh Khan in his films and adverts (2000s). For the final part of the course, we will consider queer visualities, and explore how gay and trans characters and identities have been represented in a more contemporary sense.",Spring,"CMST 21133, GNSE 23133, SALC 23133",,"Borah, Jenisha"
MADD 13238,Documenting State Violence. 100 Units.,"Visual media have become central to activism against state violence. Throughout the past century, activists have deployed new technologies to bear witness to atrocity, record evidence, raise awareness, and promote justice. At the same time, media consistently fail to deliver lasting transformations and can even enable violence rather than counteracting it. In this class, we will explore how media practices support, undermine, and complicate efforts against state violence. How have activists employed documentary evidence?What assumptions have they made about communication, truth, difference, and justice? How do media frame what counts as violence? What are the politics of recording,seeing,and showing harm? What are the possibilities and limitations of emerging digital technologies?We will explore these issues across a range of media-such as photography, documentary film, comics, holograms, satellite and drone imagery, virtual reality experiences, social media platforms, and artificial intelligence-and case studies, including the Holocaust, the Cambodian genocide, the U.S. War on Terror, the Syrian civil war, the Movement for Black Lives, Indigenous resurgence in North America, and environmental violence in Guatemala.

Can literature, art, and film contribute to political debate and systemic change as much as on-the-ground protest? In this interdisciplinary seminar, we will explore a variety of ways that grassroots activists, writers, artists, and filmmakers have made inventive use of digital media to aid in political struggles for refugee rights, gender equality, environmental justice, police abolition, data protection and privacy, and an economy founded on fair labor practices. We will be especially attuned to how their practices advocate for communities of color and other marginalized groups, who are disproportionately impacted by regimes of surveillance, state violence, and capitalist expansion. In addition to resources and tools created by digital transparency activists, we will examine how cultural practitioners make political interventions and claims with literature, art, media, and other nontraditional forms of engagement.

Recently, The High Commissioner for Human Rights called for states to place moratoriums on AI until it is compliant with human rights. This course will take the first steps towards developing a human rights-based approach for analyzing algorithms and AI. What makes an algorithm discriminatory, and is the algorithm the right place to look? Is algorithmic bias avoidable? Does human review of algorithm sufficient, and in what cases? Do predictive models violate privacy even if they do not use or disclose someone's specific data? When does nudging violate political rights? How does algorithmic decision-making impact democracy? We will closely read Shoshana Zuboff's Surveillance Capitalism on tour through the sociotechnical world of AI, alongside scholarship in law, philosophy, and computer science to breathe a human rights approach to algorithmic life. We will explore analytic toolkits from science and technology studies (STS) and the philosophy of technology to probe the relationship between worldmaking and technology through social, political, and technical lenses.

Foster's set of tangled binaries provide a foundation on which to build a formal and critical inquiry into the procedural, technological and institutional pressures involved in working with machine learning, particularly as an individual researcher or artist. Topics include: How do the datasets used for machine learning correspond to or differ from traditional physical archives? How does the speculative discourse around the potential for artificial intelligence inform data collection and usage? How has the archive's problematic history of informing and feeding on various ""-isms"" translated to the digital age and how do we respond to that situation?

At stake are issues about agency-human or material-and about determinism-how does society or culture interact with or shape its technologies, or vice versa? This course investigates theories of media ecology by exploring systems of meanings that humans embody (cultural, social, ecological) in conjunction with the emerging field of software studies about the cultural, political, social, and aesthetic impacts of software (e.g., code, interaction, interface).

MADD 14355,True Crime and Infamy in Early Modern Japan. 100 Units.,"The recent popularization of ""true crime"" in film, television shows, and podcasts has prompted critical discussions about the ethics of mixing documentary with entertainment and fact with fiction, as well as concerns about whose narratives are given public attention as others are ignored. Using these considerations as a starting point, this course examines some of the mainstays of the genre of ""true crime""-scandal, violence, disaster, law, and the supernatural-in fiction and theater in early modern Japan in order to trace the fluctuating relationship between news, fiction, and performance over the course of the Edo period. This course examines the many ways that works of literature and stage were already deeply invested in these tropes of rumor, scandal, sensation, spectacle, and documentary long before the advent of regularly circulating printed newspapers in Meiji Japan, as well as how these existing configurations of sense and sensationalism informed later developments in media and fiction. The goal of this course is for students to gain not only a breadth of knowledge about various literary and theatrical forms in early modern Japan but also a critical awareness of how early modern spectacles of infamy or violence intersected with categories of class, gender, sexuality, and disability to transform some figures into targets of sympathy and others into paragons of villainy or horror.

Through a close reading of Phoenix and related texts, this course explores the challenges genocide and other atrocities pose to traditional forms of ethics, and how we understand the human species and our role in nature. The course will also examine the flowering of manga after WWII, how manga authors bypassed censorship to help people understand the war and its causes, and the role manga and anime have played in Japan's global contributions to politics, science, medicine, technology, techno-utopianism, environmentalism, ethics, theories of war and peace, global popular culture, and contemporary Buddhism.

MADD 14822,Video Game Music and Sound. 100 Units.,"From 8-bit audio tracks to orchestral concerts of video game music, from the percussive clicks of keyboards and controllers to menu noises, sound is tightly tied to the experience of playing video games. In this course, we'll explore how game music and sound interact with narrative, the embodiment of play, and musical environments outside of the games themselves. Our engagement with game music and sound will be mostly analytical, but there will be an opportunity for a creative final project for those students who might be interested. No prior music courses are required, although some familiarity with musical terminology and experience playing video games may prove useful.",Autumn,MUSI 24822,,Will Myers

MADD 14900,"Narratives of Investigation, Games of Investigation. 100 Units.","From Agatha Christie and Marie Rodell to Victor Shklovsky, Roger Caillois, and David Bordwell, popular authors and media critics alike have long posited the mystery story as a ""game"" or ""puzzle,"" interactive exercises in guessing that are bound by certain rules and expectations of ""fair play."" Taking the implications of these authors' and critics' metaphors seriously, this class examines the mystery or detective story from the perspective of game design. Case studies will be drawn from literary examples going back to the birth of the detective story in the mid-19th century, through films, analog games and puzzles, and digital games, with an eye toward historical continuities.

MADD 15150,Histories of Technology in China. 100 Units.,"According to Bruno Latour, ""technology is society made durable."" In Francesca Bray's words, ""technologies are specific to a society, embodiments of its visions of the world and of its struggles over social order. [T]he most important work that technologies do is to produce people: the makers are shaped by the making, and the users shaped by the using."" This course looks at technologies in China since late imperial times and asks how technology both expressed and shaped visions of what Chinese society should be. We start with technologies of the body (how to sit on a kang, how to have healthy babies, how to become a deity, how to do a forensic investigation of a dead body), then move on to agricultural technologies and nutrition, to manufacturing (in sites ranging from the imperial palace to small paper workshops), and to communication technologies such as printing. Next, we look at Chinese worldviews and systems of classification and how they changed, partly due to growing exposure to views from Europe, Japan, and the Islamic world. In the last few weeks, we will look at the vernacular technologies of the Republican era, at Mao-era mass science and mass technology, and some of the contemporary uses of modern communication technology in China.

Part of the course's focus will be technological, examining the development and impact of walk cycles in cel animation, magnetic tape in analog music and analog video, and go to statements in computer programming. Another part will be sociological, examining the reverberations Einsteinian relativity in physics, Taylorist scientific management in labor, and behaviorism in psychology had within media development, industry practices, and/or the popular imagination. Taken together, the class will be a thorough investigation both into the aesthetic possibilities of the loop, and into the cultural, technological, psychological, and economic reasons it appears as a form in media construction again, and again, and again, and again, and again,",Spring,CMST 15301,,Ian Bryce Jones

MADD 15403,History of Creative Computing. 100 Units.,"What is ""creative computing""? Are artists doing computing creatively or is the computing itself being creative? In this seminar course, students will learn to discuss, analyze, and contextualize artworks covered by the blurry and interdisciplinary ""meta-medium"" that is creative computing, beginning in the 1960s and working forward to the present moment. Through lectures, hands-on exercises, and discussions of assigned readings, students will gain familiarity with core techniques and concepts that inform contemporary digital art practice and develop their own critical vocabulary and opinions. Course topics include: What (if any) are the medium specific properties of creative computing? How dependent are digital works on screens and other systems of display? How does creative computing allow us to delaminate, interject into, or interfere with the streamlined technological world around us? How do generative machine learning models connect to this conversation and how are artists working with them today?",Winter,,,Cameron Mankin
MADD 15425,"Censorship, Info Control, & Revolutions in Info Technology from the Printing Press to the Internet. 100 Units.","The digital revolution is triggering a wave of new information control efforts and censorship attempts, ranging from monopolistic copyright laws to the ""Great Firewall"" of China. The print revolution after 1450 was a moment like our own, when the explosive dissemination of a new information technology triggered a wave of information control efforts. Many of today's attempts at information control closely parallel early responses to the printing press, so the premodern case gives us centuries of data showing how diverse attempts to control or censors information variously incentivized, discouraged, curated, silenced, commodified, or nurtured art, thought, and science. This unique course is part of a collaborative research project funded by the Neubauer Collegium for Culture and Society and is co-organized with digital information expert Cory Doctorow. The course will bring pairs of experts working on the print and digital revolutions to campus to discuss parallels between their research with the class.

MADD 16312,Reforming Religious Media: Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation. 100 Units.,"The Protestant Reformation began with a carefully orchestrated media event, when Martin Luther posted his 95 theses on the door of a church in Wittenberg. Concurrently, he resorted to the still new medium of print to disseminate more widely his scathing critique of the Catholic Church's use of indulgences to communicate God's grace. This was only the beginning of Luther's sweeping attack on the Church's role as the sole mediator of salvation. No religious medium or communicational practice remained unquestioned, resulting in their comprehensive reform. Soon other reformers joined in, pushing the critique even further by questioning the need and validity of all religious mediation. Approaching the Protestant Reformation as a reform of religious media, this lecture course will give particular attention to the congenial alliance between Martin Luther's religious message and the emerging technology of the printing press, the role of Scripture in legitimating Protestant theologies of communication, controversies around particular religious media, like images or the eucharist, and the role of direct inspiration in radical reformers. This research course will be a combination of lecture and discussion. The course will culminate in an exhibition at the Special Collections Research Center of Regenstein Library, which will first take the form of a virtual web exhibit and then an actual, physical exhibition in the Winter Quarter 2020.

How have historical simulations, ensconced in media objects, represented scientific, social, and cultural processes? How do games invite players to perform and inhabit historically specific subjectivities? What is the role of digital media in the public understanding of history? By representing alternate and future histories, games articulate theories of historical change, suggesting and popularizing modes of political, economic, and social agency. We will consider how games represent the structure of time, causality, and choice, and how the hardware and software of video games constrain and enable certain representations of history. Through lectures, discussions, group play sessions, written and practice-based assignments, and theoretical readings, we will think about what it means to 'game' history and to historicize games.",Winter,KNOW 27010,,"Bolman, Bradley"

The course is divided roughly in half between still photography and film. The central theme of the course concerns the way in which photographs and films have been understood and valued during the past 165 years. There have been profound changes in attitudes and beliefs regarding the nature of photographs throughout the history of photography (this is likewise true of film). The current range of views is very different from those held by the various audiences for photographs and films in the last century and the century before. For instance, photographs were originally conceived of as copies of things that can be seen, but the notion of copy was drawn from a long-established set of views about what makes a picture a work of art and copies were said to be incapable of being works of art. This view continues to haunt the writings of some critics and historians of photography and film.

MADD 18306,Data History: Information Overload from the Enlightenment to Google. 100 Units.,"The current era of ""Big Data"" is often described as a new paradigm in science: increasingly, in fields ranging from molecular genetics to particle physics to internet search analytics, knowledge is produced by processing massive electronic databases with digital algorithms that tell us who we are, what the universe is made of , and why we think and act the way we do. At the same time, the tools, techniques, and social implications of modern data culture have a deep history that stretches back well before the advent of digital computers. Understanding the world by collecting and analyzing large quantities of information has been a goal in the natural and social sciences for centuries, and this history has shaped our current fascination with data in important and surprising ways. This course will examine the long-term history of data in critical historical context. We will examine how data has been collected, managed, and analyzed in the sciences over the past few centuries - the emergence of various technologies and conventions for information processing - as well as why it has been such a central concern in so many disciplines - what was understood to be the goal of reducing the world to data. We will also consider what social and political consequences the history of data reveals, and we will discuss the ethical and epistemological concerns that have emerged as science has become increasingly oriented towards collecting and manipulating large quantities of data.",,"HIST 29523, HIPS 28306, HIST 39523, CHSS 38306",,

By examining various genres, including those not normally interrogated by academics, such as educational and industrial films, we will consider whether there is a Chicago style of filmmaking. Technological advances that enabled both film and video to escape the restrictions of the studio and go hand-held, into city streets and homes, will be discussed. If there is a Chicago style of filmmaking, one must look at the landscape of the city-the design, the politics, the cultures and labor of its people and how they live their lives. The protagonists and villains of Chicago stories are the politicians and community organizers, our locations are the neighborhoods, and the set designers are Mies Van Der Rohe and the Chicago Housing Authority.",Spring,"HMRT 35104, CMST 31801, HMRT 25104, ARTV 20750, CMST 21801, ARCH 26750, ARTV 30750, CHST 21801",,J.

This course considers the evolution, functions, and ethics of the American desire to visit the past as a form of leisure. Starting with early themed spaces such as world's fairs, amusement parks, and cityscapes, we examine how scholars have read cultural phenomena for their radical contemporary significance. We then apply these tools to examine how Disneyland combined, redefined, and heightened its themed space antecedents and to what ends. We will learn how to decode Disneyland's messages about race, gender, capitalism, and the American experience that are embedded within the park's design, architecture, attractions, shows, sounds, and smells. How did such views of the past, present, and future speak to the social, political, and economic needs and wants of Cold War Americans, and why do they continue to resonate today? How should we understand themed spaces as a lens for U.S. history as experienced by contemporary Americans? By interrogating the themed space form, we will explore the nature of historical memory, the responsibilities of public history, and the ethics of constructing a recreational past. In doing so, we will learn how to take the seemingly frivolous matters of history seriously-and the dire stakes for doing so.",Spring,"CHST 28814, MAPS 33550, HIST 38814, HIST 28814",,"Hofmann, Alex"

MADD 20570,Technological Selves and Stories. 100 Units.,"In traditional artistic mediums, the self is presented as a narrator, a figure on a canvas, a moving image on a screen or a character on stage. Using contemporary digital technology, new selves appear within emerging forms of storytelling. What selves are these? We will take a hands-on approach to answering this question, exploring the nexus between performance, embodiment and digital representation with an eye to storytelling and dramatic narrative. Students will conduct experiments in data-based digital art, multimedia performance (blending theater and film including live-feed techniques), and virtual reality technologies. Students will accordingly be asked to create original artworks using digital technology to tell stories ranging from the personal to the mythological and even more-than-human, exploring a range of perspectives, personas and cutting-edge storytelling techniques.",Spring,TAPS 22570,,S.

MADD 21110,Imagining Futures: Speculative Design and Social Justice. 100 Units.,"This experimental course seeks to disrupt dominant narratives about ""the future"": a monolithic concept that often comes from technologists and policymakers. Instead, we explore what alternative futures might look like when imagined by and with marginalized communities. Beginning with movements such as Afrofuturism, we will read speculative and science fiction across media, including short stories, critical theory, novels, films, transmedia narratives, and digital games. Rather than merely analyzing or theorizing various futures, this course will prepare students in hands-on methods of ""speculative design"" and ""critical making."" Instead of traditional midterm essays and final research papers, the work of the course will consist primarily of blog responses to shared readings, coupled with short-form, theoretically-founded, and collaborative art projects. These projects will imagine alternative futures of climate change, gender, public health, finance, policing, and labor. The work will be challenging, transdisciplinary, and will blur expectations about the relationship between theory and practice at every turn. As such, it is not a course for the craven; it is a course for students who wish to explore the complexities of collaboration and the sociopolitical possibilities of art.

MADD 21900,Climate Change in Media and Design. 100 Units.,"If meteorological data and models show us that climate change is real, art and literature explore what it means for our collective human life. This is the premise of many recent films, novels, and artworks that ask how a changing climate will affect human society. In this course, we will examine the aesthetics of climate change across media, in order to understand how narrative, image, and even sound help us witness a planetary disaster that is often imperceptible. Rather than merely analyzing or theorizing various futures, this course will prepare students in hands-on methods of ""speculative design"" and ""critical making."" Each Tuesday, we will study how art and literature draw on the specific capacities of written and visual media to represent climate impacts, and how new humanities research is addressing climate change. Each Thursday, we will participate in short artistic exercises that explore futures of each area. These exercises include future object design, bodymapping and story circles, tabletop gameplay, and serious game design. Throughout the quarter, guest speakers from across the humanities, sciences, and social sciences will visit the class to speak about how their disciplines are working to understand and mitigate climate impacts.

MADD 22700,Devising Fundamentals. 100 Units.,"Devised theater is created from a multitude of sources but, importantly, not a preexisting script. Rather the 'script' (whether or not it eventually takes written form) is developed in rehearsal. This studio course engages students in methods of generating and crafting devised material, including but not limited to physical action, moment work, and verbatim text. Additionally we will focus on the generative power of 'problems' as a motor of creation, which draws from core principles of clowning. Through solo and collaborative projects, students will explore how devised theater wrestles with conventionally discrete roles in theater-making (writer, director, performer, dramaturg, and designer). Other considerations will include strategies for making disparate material cohere and more broadly, what constitutes a story. Select readings and case studies of artists working in devised theater will supplement the practice-based focus of the course.",Autumn,"TAPS 32700, TAPS 22700",,L. Danzig

MADD 23650,Culture Jamming in the Digital Age. 100 Units.,"From the détournement images of the Situationist International to the plundered sampled tracks of sonic outlaws, activist media artists in the later half of the 20th century deployed a medley of piratical practices in their quest to challenge and subvert our mainstream media culture. While the institutional critiques posed by these ""culture jammers"" remain as salient as ever, the creative techniques themselves no longer have the same effect in the age of social media and surveillance capitalism. As new media theorist Curt Cloninger asked in 2009, ""How do you hack/resist a platform that already allows (indeed, invites) you to customize it?"" This is the question we will set out to answer in this course. We'll look at works and study the practices of new media artists who have adapted these culture jamming techniques for the present moment. We'll learn how glitch artists exploit bugs in software to databend and datamosh media files. We'll learn how hacktivist use information security tools for creative political ends. We'll explore radical networks that exist outside the mainstream Internet and learn to tactically misuse our apps to circumvent restrictions imposed by popular platforms. At the end of this journey we'll respond to Cloninger's challenge by reframing these techniques as new modes of culture jamming for the digital age.

In moments of political struggle, what can art DO, and what can it not? We will be combining case studies with theoretical background, examining strategies like occupation, participation, parafiction, 'technologies of care,' détournement and the art strike. Students will have the opportunity to put some of these approaches to the test by designing one or more local interventions according to the interests of the group.",Spring,"ARTV 30213, TAPS 35515, ARTV 20213, TAPS 25515",,A.

MADD 24540,Multimedia Fashion Design. 100 Units.,"Multimedia Fashion Design sets out to uncover new notions of fashion and style through collaborative, interdisciplinary, and experimental approaches. Historically, garment designers sketch or illustrate their ideas with either theatrical costuming or the runway in mind as an end goal. This course embraces these traditions while also imagining a broader array of historical and contemporary media that involves fashion, like video games, animations, comics, novels, and more. We will spend time exploring the epistemology of fashion before working on our own designs, challenging each other conceptually along the way. Some students may follow the traditional path of sewing their ideas. Others may find themselves creating their work using software. Those who are brand new to art or design are also welcome--we can always sketch our ideas. Multimedia Fashion Design welcomes artists and designers who work in any medium to come together and think about how people and characters express style--the broader the array of mediums, the more dynamic our class will be.",Winter,TAPS 27540,,Takashi Shallow

An introductory, studio-oriented class on Unity and Virtual Reality development, this class explores ways of designing virtual space for platforms beyond the head-mounted display. To mine the full potential of the medium, we will adopt a slightly deconstructed approach to learning techniques while adjusting to remote learning needs. Each week's lesson starts with a conceptual prompt around which the technical knowledge revolves. Prompts include: What makes an interesting space? How would one travel through the virtual space? What kind of physicality constitutes your virtual experience? The knowledge and technique acquired in this class can serve as the building blocks for game design, data visualization, VR/AR/XR development. This course counts towards the Media Practice and Design requirement for the MAAD program.",Spring,,,Li Yao
MADD 25010,Anthropology of the Future. 100 Units.,"Two major subfields of anthropology - archaeology and ethnography - have traditionally been oriented around the human past and the human present. But what about the future? Conceptions of the future and future-oriented behavior have long been understood to be a critical plane of difference between political economies, religions, and cultural groups, yet they have rarely been an explicit focus of study. When we shift the temporal frame to the future, questions that arise include: do all cultures have theories of the future? how much about human societies are intentional? how does ideology shape future possibilities? what role do imagined futures play in political life? We will consider theories of temporality, past futures (Aztec, Polynesian, Italian), and movements such as millenarianism, messianic religions, Marxism, Dadaism, utopian communities, Afro-futurism, transhumanism, and today's neo-futurist movements that deploy radical technology and speculative design in response to looming climate change.

From 18th century parlor games to contemporary visual culture, creators have applied stochastic methods, automation, and simulation to generate music, text, and imagery. In the last five years, as machine learning has matured into broadly applicable artificial intelligence, artists have turned towards neural networks as a new frontier for creative practice. This studio course will explore the history and uses of autonomous creative tools and focus, more specifically, on leading edge artistic applications of AI. Students will receive exposure to a breadth of methods in this domain and produce multiple projects engaged with these topics.

Feminist theory, by contrast, has often been fixated on the reverse: ""objectification,"" or the process of human beings becoming like objects. This course puts into conversation these two different ways of imagining animate object-ness in order to assemble a critical archive on one of modernity's foundational binaries: the ""subject-object"" dichotomy. We will examine a series of genres that prominently feature objects, including it-narratives, narratives about robotic women, and video games, while consider these texts in relation to prominent feminist writings about objectification.

MADD 25305,Virtual Worlds and Nonhuman Narratives: Cyberspace Fiction. 100 Units.,"The joke gets at a disorienting truth: we live in a world where cyberspace increasingly leaks into the ""real"" physical space of our lives, and the two often become surrealistically conflated. We can be at once in a given geographical location and ""online,"" wafting in and out of presence in both places. We live in a world where major events transpire nowhere but ""on the Internet,"" from hacks to business transactions to relationships. These events have effects and consequences that are felt in our physical world as well. How do we tell - and read - stories that take place at least in part in virtual regions? In this course, we will investigate narrative depictions of experience that transpires in the not-quite-place of cyberspace and similar technologically-sustained virtual arenas. Earlier dream narratives anticipate this world where experience increasingly takes place online; in later narratives of virtual reality, technologically-enabled virtual landscapes confer a dreamlike (il)logic on daily experience. What can we make of the apparent rapprochement between scientific and magical paradigms here? What are the political stakes of a virtual world sometimes portrayed as anestheticizing but also sometimes a space where otherwise unavailable experiences and information can be accessed? We will examine a transatlantic range of influential twentieth-century texts as well as selections from theoretical and critical texts on communicative and information technology.",Spring,ENGL 23505,,Nell Pach
MADD 25316,After You: Curating the Art & Algorithm Debate. 100 Units.,"This course offers a unique opportunity to witness the process of - and, more importantly, actively contribute to - the conceptualization of a major exhibition of contemporary art, to be organized at the Neubauer Collegium and Smart Museum of Art in the winter and spring of 2021. The exhibition in question is titled After You: Art and Agency in the Age of Algorithms, and was conceived in dialogue with DoVA associate professor and participating artist Jason Salavon. Alluding to the specter of the post-human regime and the various challenges raised by rapid advances in digital technology in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning in particular, After You will bring together the work of a dozen artists working at the intersection of more or less traditional modes of artistic production and their algorithmic antitheses. The primary focus of After You, and therefore also of this class, are the philosophical implications of the increased role of artificial intelligence in the creation and reception of art, in particular with regards to questions of artistic intent, authorship, and originality. We will discuss this phenomenon's short but vibrant history, meet artists, read key texts (Bostrom, Joselit, Steyerl, Zuboff), and view artworks, all the while laying the didactic groundwork for the 2021 exhibit in the process: a hands-on curatorial workshop centered on one of the defining debates of our time.",Spring,"ARTH 21316, ARTH 31316",,Dieter Roelstraete

This introductory course will survey the practice, theory, and reception of so-called ""new media"" art from the late 19th century to the present day. We will examine artists' use of emerging technologies including photography, the portable video camera, the electronic computer, holography, virtual and augmented reality, and Web-based art. We will also discuss time-based art forms such as performance and dance, which made the human body their primary medium. Moving roughly chronologically, we will attend to a set of central themes: temporality and perception, the blurring of artistic and scientific practices, and intersecting questions of gender, race, and class in relation to technology. Through a combination of close looking (the careful study of the visual and material qualities of a work of art) with close reading of primary literature (artists' writings, contemporary art criticism and theory) and secondary literature (scholars' takes on these topics), students will develop the vocabulary and conceptual tools necessary to describe works of art and contextualize them historically.",Autumn,ARTH 15590,,Z.

MADD 25612,Comics as Medium. 100 Units.,"In a climate in which the borders differentiating media continue to collapse into something now referred to as ""transmedia,"" what does it actually mean for us to move between mediums-particularly mediums that raise familiar issues of representation, temporality, and narrative? The objective of this course is to provide the necessary tools to enable critical reflection on the respective values and mutual relationships of comics, art and film. To achieve this, the course is divided into two units. The first weeks will be spent acquiring the technical and historical context that will enable us to begin to recognize the breadth and depth of word/image narrative practices. After developing a core vocabulary for thinking about comics as a medium we will then look at how artists and directors have drawn on that vocabulary in a range of different contexts. Retaining a sense of the specificity of both comics and film as artistic mediums, we will consider topics ranging from cross-cultural translation, ontologies of otherness, and modes of mediated history. Beyond questions of fidelity, we will look at what it means to adapt particular stories at particular moments. How does an X-Men comic from 1982 adapt to meet the historical needs of its film adaptation in 2002? What do we mean when we say a particular adaptation is ""good"" or that another attempt ""failed""? The works this course will consider are meant to challenge our understanding of what the art of comics can be.",Spring,CMST 25612,CMST 10100 or permission of instructor,J. Rosenow
MADD 25630,Videogames and Genre Storytelling. 100 Units.,"Historically, the genre categorization of videogames has been based around what the player does. In place of iconography or thematic content, videogame genres are typically defined in terms of actions: shooting, jumping, pointing, clicking. This course takes a sideways approach to videogame genre, examining the ways in which games have taken inspiration from, and put their own unique mark on, genres borrowed from popular literature and cinema. The aesthetic formulas for popular genres such as horror, romance, comedy, science fiction, and the detective story will be examined using examples in literature and cinema, before turning to games and examining the unique challenges and interactivity brings to these genres' typical plot beats and affective techniques. How does the player-avatar relationship complicate point-of-view and identification in the horror genre? What happens to the literary rules of ""fair play"" in detective stories as they are adapted into actual game form? Can the performative pain of slapstick be successfully adapted into interactive form? How do dating games re-structure the traditional forms of intimacy of the romance novel and cinematic rom com? This course will take advantage of the resources of the Weston Game Lab of the Media Arts, Data, and Design Center, and will be structured around played examples, in addition to examples from popular literature and film.",Autumn,CMST 27840,,Ian Bryce Jones

MADD 25722,The Musical Interface: Constraint and Creativity. 100 Units.,"Music-making involves constraint: the layout of a keyboard or guitar, the poetic systems of an epic storyteller, the practice techniques of a singer who cultivates a certain sound, or even the lines of code that an algorithmic music-maker strings together. New technologies bring new rules, as well as new ways to break the rules: autotuned vocals are no longer derided, and tools like Melodyne are now a standard part of music production. Constraint, then, produces creativity-but how does this look with particular instruments and traditions? How do artists make the most of their tools? In this hands-on class, we will explore the interface through the concepts of affordance, interval systems, algorithms, and generalizable schemas. You won't just analyze art: you will also produce it and discuss your experiences with each type of interface. Our topics will include electronic music constructed on digital audio workstations and through code, the piano keyboard, the harmonica, Korean p'ansori sung storytelling, streaming platforms and recommendation algorithms, and the Italian solfeggio tradition.

MADD 26059,"Media, Environment, and Risk. 100 Units.","In 1991, Ulrich Beck wrote that ""society is made into a laboratory."" Following the Chernobyl disaster, Beck articulated how modern technology and its potential side-effects-such as radiation or chemical poisoning-had created the novel epistemological category of environmental risk defined by threats that escape human perception and transcend borders. Institutions monitoring ecological conditions gained responsibility for communicating public health. Political conflicts emerged between formations of expert and lay environmental knowledge. The technological application of modern science, and its associated environmental risks, pushed research beyond the laboratory and into the governmental fabric of social order: nuclear reactors had to be constructed and chemicals distributed to populations before their properties and safety could be understood. This seminar reads the debates on risk in environmental sociology alongside the emergence of risk criticism in media studies to interrogate the probabilistic thinking inherent to the communication of ecological threat. Two common traits characteristic of recent environmental catastrophes ranging from Bhopal, Fukushima Daiishi, Deepwater Horizon, Exxon Valdez, Hurricane Katrina, and the varied crises of global climate change, are that each disaster involves the failure or side-effect of an implemented technological project and that the corresponding risks-whether imperceptible or probable-are necessarily communicated to publics by media",Winter,"CMST 42802, HIPS 26059, CHSS 36059, SOCI 30329, KNOW 36059",,Thomas Pringle

MADD 26531,"Race, New Media, and Youth Movements for Justice. 100 Units.","Although racial inequality is an enduring force in American society, new forms of activism--often facilitated by through new media--are changing the terms of political debate around issues of race, gender, power, and justice. From #BlackLivesMatter to #MeToo, sites of political struggle have become increasingly decentered and accessible to a broader array of people. And as is often the case, youth from marginalized groups are at the forefront of these struggles, redefining what counts as political and how to conceive of important concepts like equity, community, and dignity. This seminar-style course explores the past and present conditions that give rise to these youth-led movements, drawing from multiple scholarly lenses, including political science, sociology, literature, performance, film, and visual culture. Specifically, the course explores how young activists and cultural workers, who often identify as people of color, women, queer, and/or undocumented, draw on legacies of activism whilst making political claims using media, art, technology, or other nontraditional forms of participation.

MADD 27022,Surveillance Media. 100 Units.,"Surveillance media are ubiquitous: in your pocket, on the street, at school, underground, and in the air. They work incessantly and quietly, often without our knowledge but always with the goal of producing knowledge about us. But they don't do so equally. Wedded to concepts of security, risk, and crisis, surveillance is itself a technology of power. While some of us benefit from surveillance in certain contexts, many others are disproportionally targeted based on differences of race, gender, sexuality, class, religious affiliation, ability, citizenship, and more. This course will explore how surveillance media distribute power in the United States and across its global connections. Throughout, we will understand surveillance media not only as the specific technologies used for surveillance, but also how these technologies differentially mediate our bodies, behaviors, communities, and political relationships. Beginning with various theoretical frameworks of surveillance, this course will track surveillance media across various sites and systems. These include borders, policing, drones, algorithms, and labor. In each, we will examine both contemporary and historical materials in order to consider how our dominant ideas and values about surveillance media are rooted in the ideologies and violences of capitalism, colonialism, and empire.

While concentrating on American imagery, the context would be international, reflecting the condition of popular graphic arts in this country. Among other things it would treat book illustration, posters, advertising art, magazines and newspapers, cartooning, postcards, children's literature, commercial paper, and trade catalogs. Necessarily, given this wide scope, it will be episodic in character, but it will also attempt to relate this visual explosion to larger artistic movements, major events, technological changes, and political trends. It would also explore, from time to time, the roles played by collecting, exhibition, and academic commentary in legitimating the subject, as well as the power of ethnic and racial stereotyping and the multiplication of trade and printing journals. The aim, in short, is to examine the flowering of a visual print culture that had its roots in the Gutenberg Revolution of the 15th century. There will be both class discussion and lecturing.

MADD 27915,"Introduction to Videogame Studies: Art, Play, and Society. 100 Units.","This course is intended as an introduction to the study of videogames in the humanities. Topics include videogame form (visual style, spatial design, sound, and genre); videogames as a narrative medium; embodiment and hapticity in videogame play; issues of identity/identification, performance, and access related to gender, sexuality, race and ethnicity, ability, and class; and rhetorical, educational, and political uses of videogames. Just as the videogame medium has drawn from older forms of art and play, so the emerging field of videogame studies has grown out of and in conversation with surrounding disciplines. With this in mind, readings and topics of discussion will be drawn both from videogame studies proper and from other fields in the humanities - including, but not limited to, English, art history, and cinema and media studies. Undergraduates should be prepared for an MA-level reading load but will write final papers of the standard length for upper-level undergraduate courses (8-10 pages versus 12-15 for MA students). MA students interested in pursuing a particular research topic in-depth will be given supplemental readings. This course will also be designed to take advantage of the University of Chicago's videogame collection, and will require game play both individually and as part of group play sessions.",Spring,"MAPH 34515, CMST 27915, ENGL 24515, CMST 37915, ENGL 34515",,Christopher Carloy

MADD 28008,Sound and Scandal: How Media Make Believe. 100 Units.,"Why has lip syncing caused so many scandals and successes across media, from Milli Vanilli to drag? Primarily focusing on American film, TV, music videos, and animation, this course investigates how sound synchronization creates alternate identities and realities. We may think we know lip sync and voice synthesis when we see and hear them, but close reading unveils deeper issues of technological construction and gendered performances. For example, Singin' in the Rain dramatizes film's transition to sound as technicians struggled to match the ""right"" voice to the ""right"" body: a beautiful woman with an ugly voice lip syncs to the lovely voice of a woman who Hollywood deems unsuitable to appear onscreen. From The Jazz Singer to today's alarmingly authentic deepfakes and vocaloids, we will diagnose how vocal appropriation and synthesis conjure states of credibility and belief. We will ask how lip sync authenticates talking animals and faux rockers. Questions of star power and authorship confronting performances of gender and sexuality. No matter the motive, vocal manipulation can never be taken at face value, especially in an age when contortions between sounds and their sources can be passed off as truth.",Spring,"CMST 28008, TAPS 20208, MUSI 28008",,

How do fleeting acts-onstage, online, or in the streets-spark curiosity, provoke debate, or ripple through memes and memories? In this course, we'll immerse ourselves in the bold, hybrid world of performance as a tool for upending expectations and crafting the unexpected. With hands-on projects, critical reflection, and collaborative exploration, we will investigate performance in its many forms, from physical spaces where people move, connect, and gather, to digital platforms where swipes, clicks, and streams define interaction. Together, we'll uncover how performers outwit algorithms, engineer surprise, and amplify their work in resourceful and unpredictable ways. Visiting artists from theater, media art, and tactical performance will join the course throughout the quarter, bringing unique practices and perspectives into the mix.",Autumn,"ARTV 20703, TAPS 28250, SIGN 28250",,"D. de Mayo, J.

At the same time, religious and philosophical sources have been thinking the concept of virtuality for centuries. Responding to popular efforts to ask how religion should respond to advances in technology and mass media, we will ask how religious thought has laid the groundwork for and even anticipated these advances, and therefore how it can be used as a resource to address contemporary ethical and political challenges. This class will take us from ancient Jerusalem to cyberspace in order to interrogate the various contexts and guises in which the problem of virtual reality has appeared.

While not adopted into the canon, these texts, which are often referred to as the New Testament Apocrypha, have had much influence on later literature, art, liturgy, and popular culture. The course provides a survey of these texts, which include gospels of the life of Jesus, acts of the lives of different apostles, and apocalypses of heavenly realms. In this course, we will explore a variety of questions: What were these alternative early stories about Jesus and his followers? Why were these texts written and for whom? What authority did these non-canonical accounts have? What can an analysis of these texts tell us about how textual authority is construed across religious traditions, especially in terms of popular piety? How can these accounts change our perception of early Christianity?

The course will examine the history of this question, focusing especially on the tradition of thought that grounds political legitimacy in claims about human nature, and that which locates it in the consent of the governed. We will read classic representatives of political naturalism such as Aristotle and Aquinas, examine the role of popular sovereignty in Marsilius of Padua's intervention in debates between pope and emperor, consider the attempts of late-Scholastic thinkers such as Suarez to bridge naturalism and government by consent, and explore the emergence of social contract theory in early Enlightenment thinkers such as Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau. Throughout, we will focus on a close reading of primary texts, seeking to understand how these philosophers thought about the source of political authority and how their theories were shaped by their historical contexts.

MDVL 22350,Speaking Truth to Power in Medieval Iberia. 100 Units.,"In the multilingual and multireligious environment of the Iberian middle ages, poetry can express many things. And while literary history has granted a prestigious space to some of these things, such as love or spirituality, it has consistently neglected others, such as socio-political satire or vulgarity. This class will be paying attention to that other less talked-about poetry that gets into the political struggles of the period, that talks in profanities about profane things. In other words, the poetry that does not speak to the eternity of existence, but that gets its hands dirty with earthly matters. The poetry that savagely mocks and cuts through social conventions in a way that makes seem contemporary Twitter trolls benevolent in comparison. For this class we will be reading authors who wrote in Galician-Portuguese such as Joao Soares de Paiva or King Alfonso X, authors who wrote in Catalan such as Guillem de Bergueda or Ramon Vidal de Besalu, and authors who wrote in Spanish such as Juan Ruiz or Juan de Mena.

The ""Vita Nova"" is an essential text for readers of Dante's Commedia since the poet constantly refers back to it, and we will read it keeping in mind this dialogue. However, our primary focus will be to examine the ""Vita Nova"" in the context of contemporaneous literary practices. How does Dante engage with the philosophical and aesthetic debates of his time? We will use ""Vita Nova"" to gain entry into the larger world of early Italian poetry (Guittone, Guinizzelli, Cavalcanti, and others) and we will examine his contribution to the courtly love tradition.",Course not offered in 24-25,"ITAL 23101, ITAL 33101",,H.

MDVL 23425,Love in the Middle Ages. 100 Units.,"In this course, we will focus on the theme of love in the literary production of late medieval Italy (13th and 14th centuries). During these centuries, love emerges as a dominant literary motif, sparking dynamic and multifaceted debates. Rather than conforming to a singular perspective, Italian authors articulate a broad spectrum of viewpoints - ranging from fervent celebrations of passionate love to vehement critiques of profane love, and from bold attempts to reconcile sacred and profane love to stark depictions of their irreconcilability. Through close readings of both poetic and prose texts, we will explore how these diverse representations not only illuminate the complex nature of love and its literary expression, but also engage with the broader historical context. Particular attention will be devoted to the ways in which literary discourse on love intersects with the socio-political, philosophical, and cultural developments of late medieval Italy. By adopting this interdisciplinary approach, we will move beyond a purely emotional conception of love, framing it as a passion deeply intertwined with the civic and cultural milieu of the time. Readings will include works by Sicilian poets, Guittone d'Arezzo, Guido Guinizzelli, Bonagiunta Orbicciani, Guido Cavalcanti, Dante Alighieri, Francesco Petrarch, and Giovanni Boccaccio, among others.",Spring,ITAL 23425,,Caterina Nicodemo

Ranging from the silent era to the present day, from arthouse pictures to swashbuckling epics, we will consider the uses of medievalism in the modern imagination. Where do these cultural fantasies come from? How do they change over time? How do they relate to the academic disciplines of history and medieval studies? And what role does cinema play in these questions? Screenings will be complemented with readings both from medieval source documents and from contemporary film and cultural theory. Works discussed will include ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" (Carl Theodor Dreyer, 1929), ""The Flowers of Saint Francis"" (Roberto Rossellini, 1950), ""The Seventh Seal"" (Ingmar Bergman, 1957), ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" (1975), ""Braveheart"" (Mel Gibson, 1995), and ""Hard to be a God"" (Aleksei German, 2014), among others.",Winter,ITAL 23625,,Jane Vincent

We will then proceed with the reading and analysis of the most significant cantos of the ""Inferno."" In particular, the protagonist's path of redemption will be examined in its autobiographical and allegorical dimension. In his dual identity of author and character, Dante takes on the role of judge (the author), who accuses and condemns his contemporaries, and of penitent (the character), who finds himself in front of the same passions and sins that tormented his earthly life. We will try to understand how the ambiguous and eternal charm of the great characters of the ""Inferno"" (Francesca, Farinata, Pier della Vigna, Brunetto, Ulysses, Ugolino) arises from the conflict between these two dimensions. Upon completion of the course, students should have improved their ability to think critically, and to understand and analyze a literary text on different levels of meaning.

The flowering of political philosophy in the medieval Islamic world provides a mirror for examining our own assumptions about religion, politics, and philosophy. In this course, students read major works by Muslim and Jewish thinkers who debated whether and how to apply philosophical ideas to the political life of a community governed by divine laws. We will begin by discussing the transmission of Greek philosophy into Arabic-Islamic culture, the debates that ensued over the status of ""foreign wisdom,"" and the issue of esoteric writing. These preliminary topics provide necessary background for studying the tradition of political philosophy that developed under Islam and Judaism in the Middle Ages.

Are they two different modes of oppression and discrimination or are they part of a similar phenomenon? Moreover, are they religious, racial, or ethnic forms of discrimination? Throughout this course, we will complicate the media narrative that sees Jews and Arabs as perpetual enemies through a historical and philosophical exploration into the origins and development of Orientalism, Islamophobia, and antisemitism. Students will think historically about the construction of race, ethnicity, and religion, and the discriminatory modes by which these are employed; and they will use that knowledge to think critically about current depictions of anti-Jewish and anti-Islamic violence. In the first part of the course, we will consider the historical and conceptual underpinnings of antisemitism and Islamophobia. We will look to 14th and 15th century Spain in order to better understand how and where they originated; we will then track their development through modernity, paying close attention to how these discourses changed and evolved over time; finally, we will look at the impact of the Holocaust and the rise of the State of Israel and consider current iterations of Islamophobia and antisemitism in Europe and America today.",Spring,"JWSC 29104, HIST 26009, RLST 29104",,Mendel Kranz

NEHC 20110,Media Islam. 100 Units.,"Media are increasingly integrated into contemporary life. As in the past, we consume media-watching movies and television, listening to music and podcasts, and following influencers on social media. However, these passive activities now overlap with media production, participation, and commentary. For Muslims negotiating identity in diverse global society, media figure into representation and self-representation in complex, often subtle, ways. Intersecting with the family, mosque, community, and other core social institutions, media play a central role in contemporary Muslim experience. This class will examine religious media, i.e. those branded as ""Islamic"" in some fashion, such as television programs on Islamic law, or social media content with explicit religious commitments and claims to authority. It will also consider how Islam has been represented in popular culture, and the ways Muslims have related to those constructions of their faith. However, this dichotomy of religious and popular media no longer holds with Muslim-oriented television shows like Ramy, Ms. Marvel, the integration of Islam into popular American entertainment from Jack Ryan to Mr. Robot, and the complex engagement with religion in media across the historically Muslim world.",Autumn,RLST 29110,,"Maguire, Tom"

Is it a ""Fertile Crescent,"" a paradisaical land of milk and honey? Or is it a barren place requiring special effort to ""make the desert bloom""? The Middle East presents a unique environmental context as an arid zone that is nevertheless rich in agricultural and natural resources. It is also a region that has been the focus of intensive imperial, colonial, and settler-colonial projects in the modern era. How were Ottoman, French, British, American, and Zionist efforts to control this land shaped by environmental factors - imagined or real - and how did they in turn shape the environment they sought to control? In this course we will chart the development of these colonial and imperial projects, and resistance to them, across the history of the modern Middle East. We will then engage with recent work in Middle Eastern environmental history to collectively interpret these projects through the lens of their environmental entanglements.

They read early Greek in Linear B tablets, ancient Mayan in Meso­ameri­can glyphs, an unsuspected Indo-European language in curious Anatolian hieroglyphs, and other long-forgotten languages in other scripts, some of them cracked only recently. In this course we will examine several famous and not-so-famous decipherments: how scholars deciphered these scripts, decoded their languages and brought their literatures and cultures back to life. We will also consider why so many scripts must be deciphered-why some scripts and languages have died out so completely that they have been forgotten. Finally, we will investigate a number of scripts that have yet to be deciphered, such as Etruscan, the Rongorongo script of Easter Island (pictured above), and the knot-based writing system of the Inca khipus, and consider why they remain unsolved.",,NEHC 30718,,

NEHC 22502,Persian Literary Translation Through the Translation of Hafez. 100 Units.,"Persian Literary Translation Through the Translation of Hafez Translating poetry is often a challenging endeavor, but translating Persian classical poetry is especially complex for several reasons, including the genre's prevalence of ebhām (ambiguity) and ihām (polyvalence). These challenges have caused many literary translators to dub Hafez's poetry as practically untranslatable, yet nonetheless there have been many attempts at translation, with varying degrees of success. This course aims to both explore the specific challenges translators of Hafez have encountered and also to strengthen students' literary translation skill through the translation of Hafez's works. After conducting a survey of existing translations of Hafez and other Persian classical poets, hands-on translations of several ghazals of Hafez will foster a better understanding of the multilayered meanings of his poetry. In addition, published as well as video sources on literary translation will serve as an introduction to prevailing theories of translation and to efficient methodologies of translating literary texts. The course being essentially designed to familiarize students with the practice of translation, students will create and refine their own translations of selected poems of Hafez.

Zionism has mostly been considered a secular project, yet recently, Zionist theory is scrutinized to identify and unearth its supposedly hidden theological origins. In nowadays Israel, a rise in religious identification alongside an increasing religionization of the political discourse calls for the consideration of new theopolitical models of Zionism applicable in a post-secular environment. The aim of this course is to explore this complex intertwining of politics and religion in Israel from both historical and contemporary perspectives. The first part of the course will outline the theoretical foundation of post-secular and political-theological discourses.

During this time, we have come to an increasingly refined understanding of the ways the brain processes sound. It remains the case, however, that not all sound is music, and in this course we will investigate how musical sound is organized to make it musical, and how this organization reflects the capacities of the human mind. Interactive lectures (Mondays and Wednesdays) and discussion sections (Fridays) will engage both scientific and humanistic literature. Among the topics the class will engage are the origins and functions of music, absolute pitch, music and memory, how music shapes emotional responses, movement and music, connections between music and images, and the relationship between music and language.",,SIGN 26066,,Lawrence Zbikowski

Instead of an area study, we concern ourselves with listening to sound worlds, local and global. We balance the reading of primary and secondary sources-the writings of travelers and practitioners alongside theoretical treatises and modern ethnomusicological scholarship-with the different listening practices, especially collections and assemblages of recorded sound and film. Each student will develop her or his own means of entering different sound worlds. Accordingly, students with varying degrees of musical background will be able to navigate the Indian Ocean World in ways suitable to their own backgrounds and interests.

MUSI 23324,The Human Form in Contemporary Art. 100 Units.,"In a present where humanity faces planetary challenges with an unprecedented urgency, the human form - what Marx calls our ""genus-being"" (Gattungswesen) - has become a focus for artistic production of all sorts. The thesis of the class is this: Contemporary art is an actualization of the human form that doesn't presuppose the form, doesn't take it for granted, but instead troubles the form and poses it as a question. The class considers presentations of the form in performance art (Tino Sehgal, Anne Imhof, Wu Tsang), sculpture (Kara Walker, Cai Guo-Qiang, Cecilia Vicuña), writing (Friederike Mayröcker, Layli Long Soldier, Tracie Morris), sound (Maria Chavez, Christina Kubisch, Samson Young), and painting (Michael Armitage, Tammy Nguyen, Mark Bradford).

MUSI 23410,Music of the Middle East. 100 Units.,"Historically one of the most complex and contested regions in the world, Israel/Palestine has a music culture that bears witness to processes of connection and separation. The politics of music in Israel/Palestine grow from conflicted beliefs about authenticity and ownership, the sounds of difference and sameness. The sacred and the secular intersect, and boundaries of practice and genre both divide and unite. Local practices have never been independent of global movement, be it in diaspora, pilgrimage, or the distant residence of refugees. The musical landscape of the region, therefore, has shifted throughout history, accessible primarily through the archaeology of music scholarship. In this proseminar we shall look at specific moments when the musics of Israel/Palestine converged, responding to and shaping historical change and conflict. We shall explore musical repertories and practices of all kinds, whether sacred or secular, vernacular or élite.",Winter.

MUSI 23509,Eurovision. 100 Units.,"Each May since 1956 popular musicians and fans from Europe gather in a European metropolis to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC), a competitive spectacle in which musicians from one nation compete against one another. Organized, funded, and broadcast by the European Broadcasting Union, the largest conglomerate of national radio and television networks in the world, the ESC is extensively participatory, creating its own communities of fans, musicians, musical producers, and ordinary citizens, who join together at all levels of society to interact with the politics and historical narratives of Europe. From the moment of heightened Cold War conflict at the birth of ESC to the refugee crisis and the rise of right-wing nationalism in the present, ESC has generated public discourse that not only reflects European and global politics, but provides a conduit for local and national citizenries to respond and shape such public discourse about gender and sexuality. The weekly work for the course draws students from across the College into the counterpoint of history and politics with aesthetics and popular culture. Each week will be divided into two parts, the first dedicated to reading and discussion of texts about European history and politics from World War II to the present, the second to interaction with music. Students will experience the ESC through close readings of individual songs and growing familiarity with individual nations with a participatory final project.",Various,"TAPS 23509, SIGN 26044, GNSE 23509",100-level music course or consent of instructor.,P.

This class explores the intersections between music, theater, dance, and ""the highest court of the land."" We will discuss how the court has defined ""performance"" in various intellectual property and arts-related opinions. We will analyze recent justices' own performances in the courtroom, at the Washington National Opera, and on the salsa dance floor. And we will watch, listen to, and interpret songs, operas, plays, and films that set the text of Supreme Court opinions. By the end of the quarter, students should understand how performance shapes the making and the memory of American law, and how law shapes the concept and the content of artistic performance. Weekly readings and screenings will include excerpts from secondary sources, Supreme Court oral arguments and opinions, and musical and theatrical performances. To gain experience both reading law and presenting in public, students will perform a short spoken, danced, and/or musical setting of a Supreme Court opinion (this can be an existing artistic setting or one of students' own devising), and will write a five-page paper analyzing how their chosen artistic setting inflects the judicial rhetoric of the opinion.",Winter,TAPS 20240,,C.

Issues of musical style, questions of historiography, the technologies and techniques of audio recording, the structures of the recording industry, the status of so-called subcultures and mainstreams, and the politics of gender, race and sexuality are among the items which our readings, class discussions and assignments will explore. As such, the inculcation of an ""appreciation"" of rock, the transmission of a canon and the validation of individual musical tastes are projects that are antithetical to our inquiry. Students will also be encouraged, through select readings and listening assignments, to contextualize rock within a broad ﬁeld of twentieth- and twenty-ﬁrst century music-making and attendant social, political and economic processes.",,MUSI 33804,,Travis Jackson
MUSI 23805,Rock/Genre. 100 Units.,"This proseminar analyzes rock music's complex, evolving legacy in global culture and the study of popular music and genre. For better or worse, we still think and hear popular music through rock. Tangled up in the political upheavals of and around 1968, rock music continues to shape how musicians and scholars imagine political agency and how music might make a difference. Later musicians have sought to recapture rock's alleged disruptive potential in ever-new paradigms: prog rock, punk, metal, and many more. Scholars, too, looked to rock music when they began to study subcultures and supposedly counter-hegemonic cultural production. As the semi-mythical archetype of ""popular music that doesn't care about being popular,"" rock helped establish the study of recorded popular music and genre. We will scrutinize rock music's ambivalent legacy in forming new musical, political, and scholarly discourses with readings, research projects, presentations, and discussions. Since we will try to understand the whole of popular music through rock, this course will benefit greatly from participants with diverse musical backgrounds and skill sets.",Spring,MUSI 33805,,Florian Walch

MUSI 24722,Music and Environment. 100 Units.,"Over the last four centuries, how have the creators and practitioners of Western art music imagined nature as a recurring other-a foil to the art and artifice of our human world? This course is a trans-historical survey of the multifaceted relationships between musical creators, audiences, and the natural world. Over the 10-week course we will explore humankind's evolving relationship with the environment, calling upon a diverse array of composers, performers, and artists. While music offers a space in which to contemplate our relationship with nature, the natural world has long offered an opportunity for artists to expand their horizons, suggesting new sonic resources, new ways of performing, and new understandings of temporality. The course is organized in three large modules: listening to the environment, representing the environment, and speaking for the environment. The first introduces a set of listening practices-deep listening and soundwalks-to explore how these listening practices open up a range of possibilities for the interpenetration of natural sounds within musical performances, and musical performances in outdoor spaces. The second module turns our focus toward transliterations of natural phenomena and animal sounds, mediated through instrumental or electronic renderings.

In this class, we will look at many of these shifting images of the famous Leipzig composer. Was he the pious Thomaskantor dutifully churning out his cantatas and passions or the intellectual wizard of an abstract and dying fugal art? A belated hero of German nationalism, or a universal icon of musical humanity celebrated by many as the greatest composer of all time? We will do a fair amount of readings that reflect many of these changing views of Bach. But we will also spend much of our time listening to-and studying-his music, seeing what clues he has offered to help us understand this most enigmatic of composers. While an advanced understanding of music theory is not a prerequisite for this course, it will be important that you can read music and helpful to have a foundational understanding of harmony and counterpoint.",Spring,GRMN 25422,,Thomas Christensen

MUSI 25721,Music of the Black Radical Tradition. 100 Units.,"Black artists are often written out of the history of musical experimentalism. John Cage's place in the canon is secure, but what of Cecil Taylor's? Or Anthony Braxton's? Or Matana Roberts's? Labels like ""jazz"" or ""free jazz"" segregate these artists from white experimentalists, suggesting that their music is best understood within a narrowly racialized genre category, rather than as part of the experimental mainstream, with its assumed whiteness, institutional support, and inbuilt prestige. This course redresses this imbalance by centering the music of Black radical composers in the latter half of the twentieth century. We will study the music of a wide range of composers, including many associated with the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM), one of the most venerable musical collectives of the twentieth century, rooted right here in Chicago's South Side. The course will tack between studies of the music's sounds and its historical, political, and ideological contexts. We will develop critical and analytical language for engaging the often-bracing sound worlds of those composers while building out a contextual understanding of their work as at once capaciously experimental and situated in a political context of resistance.",Spring,CRES 25721,,Steve Rings

But cognition also has limited capacity, and humans expend a lot of effort trying to enhance that capacity in health and disease. This course will examine the neural mechanisms that enable and limit cognitive processes like learning, memory and decision making. We will also study behavioral and clinical efforts to enhance cognition in health and disease. These topics are very active areas of research, with new discoveries published every week. We will therefore focus on the primary literature. Each class will contain a discussion of an original research article, a wider ranging conversation about related issues and findings, and an overview of the next topics. We will focus on studies that use animal models to relate the activity of neurons to cognition and on behavioral and imaging work in humans.

PHIL 10005,Introduction to the Philosophy of Love. 100 Units.,"Love is one of the most important, profound things in life; and yet, it is notoriously hard to articulate just what love is. In this course, we will inquire about the nature of love, addressing some of the central questions that have occupied philosophers of love. Why do we love what we love? Who can love, and who can be loved? What does love demand of us, and how can we love well? What is the relationship between love and morality? And what is love? We will seek an understanding of love that can account, in particular, for the central role that love plays in human life - the sense in which it is ""what makes the world go 'round."" We will discuss historical and contemporary philosophical texts, such as Plato's Symposium, bell hooks' all about love, and Harry Frankfurt's The Reasons of Love, as well as literature and film. In the course of our inquiry, we will consider the ways that philosophical reflection - with its focus on conceptual clarity, rational argumentation, and communicative precision - can be enriched by literature and film while, in turn, helping us to better understand literature, film, and life.",Summer,,,
PHIL 10250,The World of Greek Philosophy. 100 Units.,"This course will serve as an introduction to ancient Greek philosophy and literature of the pre-Classical, Classical, and Hellenistic Greek world, and their conceptions that at once influence and differ from our own. In addition to discussing traditional Greek understandings of virtue, honor, and happiness, we will consider how intellectual life was believed to help people find meaning, purpose,and self-fulfillment and shape their ethics. We will recreate the experience of Greek intellectual culture in simulated marketplace disputations and (nonalcholic) symposia while reading and discussing works from Pre-Socratics, Plato, Aristotle, Sophocles, Euripides, Euclid, and the Stoics, in an effort to understand not just what but how they thought.",Summer,,,
PHIL 20002,Thomas Aquinas's Metaphysics of Morals: The Goodness and Badness of Human Actions. 100 Units.,"Thomas Aquinas's account of the goodness and badness that are proper to human actions-moral goodness and badness-is fundamental for his entire ethical teaching. It provides the rationale for his way of dividing human actions into kinds; it sets the reference points for his theory of virtues and vices, which he takes to be nothing other than principles of good and bad actions; it explains the moral function that he ascribes to law; and so on. The aim of this course will be to understand and think about that account. Its fullest presentation is found in Aquinas's masterpiece, the Summa theologiae. However, the Summa's approach to ethics is heavily metaphysical, and nowhere is this more true than in its treatment of moral goodness and badness. We shall therefore need to consult background passages from other parts of that work and other works of his, on such metaphysical topics as good and bad in general, powers and their objects, the nature of circumstances, and the relation between intellect and will. We shall also want to consider to what extent the account depends on strictly theological notions.",Spring,FNDL 21002,Completion of the general education requirement in humanities is required.,Stephen Brock

His approach is both philosophically sophisticated and quite different from that of modern science. We will work through substantial selections from Books I-III, with the help of Aquinas's glosses, which make them more digestible without diluting them. Topics include the subject and procedure of natural science, the relation of that science to metaphysics and mathematics, matter and form as principles of change, the concept of nature, causality, chance, teleology, the nature of motion, action and passion, and the categories of being.

PHIL 20106,"Perception, Language, and Action: an Introduction to Sartre and Merleau-Ponty. 100 Units.","The thoughts of Sartre and Merleau-Ponty are intertwined throughout their philosophical developments. Both take their departure in phenomenology's central insight that the mind transcends itself toward the world and the attending dissolution of the false problem of how the mind can hook up onto the world. As Sartre once put it: ""Each of us was trying to understand the world insofar as he could, and with the means at his disposal. And we had the same means - then called Husserl and Heidegger - as we were similarly disposed."" (""Merleau-Ponty vivant"") At the same time, Sartre and Merleau-Ponty were both dissatisfied with the accounts that Husserl and Heidegger provided of the relations between perception, language and action. German phenomenology, they argue, stumbles over the problems of other minds and history. However, their respective diagnoses are fundamentally divergent, and so are the alternative accounts that they seek to articulate. The aim of the course is to introduce students to the thoughts of Sartre and Merleau-Ponty by attending to the life-long philosophical debate between them. It is driven by the hypothesis that each of the two authors is at once the most penetrating reader and the deepest critic of the other. Although the course will recurrently present their philosophies against the background of concepts and problems bequeathed by the analytic tradition and in the light of recent debates in analytic philosophy.",Spring,PHIL 30106,,Jean-Philippe Narboux

PHIL 21011,Metaontology. 100 Units.,"Ontology is, in Quine's phrase, the study of ""what there is."" Ontologists debate the existence and nature of numbers, properties, propositions, ordinary objects, possibilia, and so on. Metaontology asks about the status of this discourse and tries to characterize its goals and prospects. What does it mean to say that something exists? Are there criteria of 'ontological commitment'? How do the things ontologists debate relate to what ordinary people say? After an historical introduction, the first part of the course will survey a few first-order ontological debates. The remainder of the course will consider varieties of realism and of anti-realism in metaontology. We will read authors such as Rudolf Carnap, W. V. O.

PHIL 21206,Philosophy of Race and Racism. 100 Units.,"The idea that there exist different ""races"" of human beings is something that many-perhaps even most-people in the United States today take for granted. And yet modern notions of ""race"" and ""racial difference"" raise deep philosophical problems: What exactly is race? Is race a natural kind (like water) or a social kind (like citizenship)? If race is a social kind-i.e. something human beings have constructed-are there any good reasons to keep using it? According to many philosophers, these questions cannot be properly analyzed in abstraction from the history of modern racism and the liberation struggles racial oppression has given rise to. Together, we'll read classic and contemporary texts on these themes by authors such as W.E.B. Du Bois, Frantz Fanon, Angela Davis, Charles Mills, Naomi Zack, Chike Jeffers, Kwame Anthony Appiah, and Lucius Outlaw. (A)",Spring,"PHIL 31206, RDIN 31206, RDIN 21206",,Tyler Zimmer

Over the last decades - arguably centuries - this commitment to a 'critical' theory has developed into a lively philosophical tradition with a series of core texts at its foundation. In this course, we will carefully read through the most influential works within this tradition, focusing especially on what has become known as the 'Frankfurt School' and its origins. Our readings will include works by Hegel, Marx, Gramsci, Fanon, Horkheimer, Adorno and Marcuse. Overarching themes of our discussion will be the relation between knowledge and emancipation, between ideology and the self, and between theory and practice. (A)",Spring,,,Laurenz Ramsauer

PHIL 21505,"Wonder, Magic, and Skepticism. 100 Units.","In the course of discussing how it is that a philosophical problem arises in the first place, Wittgenstein says, ""The decisive movement in the conjuring trick has been made, and it was the very one that we thought quite innocent."" This isn't the only place where Wittgenstein speaks as if being gripped by philosophical problems is a matter of succumbing to illusions--as if a philosophers are magicians who are taken in by their own tricks. In this course, we'll discuss philosophy and magical performance, with the aim of coming to a deeper understanding of what both are about. We'll be particularly concerned with Wittgenstein's picture of what philosophy is and does. Another focus of the course will be the passion of wonder. In the Theaetetus, Plato has Socrates say, ""The sense of wonder is the mark of the philosopher. Philosophy indeed has no other origin."" And when magicians write about their aesthetic aims, they almost always describe themselves as trying to instill wonder in others. Does magic end where philosophy begins? And what becomes of wonder after philosophy is done with it?

PHIL 21830,Moral Philosophy. 100 Units.,"In this course we will read, write, talk, and think about good and bad, right and wrong, in human life and conduct. In doing so, we usually will be preoccupied with questions about the relation between morality and reason. Almost everyone agrees that doing what morality asks or requires (and refraining from doing what morality prohibits) usually means losing out on at least some opportunities to do as one likes. There is normally something one would rather do than, say, keep a promise. The most detailed accounts of reason in action, however, suggest that reason is meant to help us fare well. Faring well is often a matter of managing to do well for oneself, often by finding ways of doing as one likes. If morality works against the pursuit of self-interest, and reason helps to further pursuit of self-interest, it looks as though there is a fundamental conflict between reason and morality, between acting well and faring well.

But what is autonomy, and why is it capable of inspiring such controversy? This class considers the twists and turns of autonomy's fate within and beyond the German Idealist tradition. We will start by considering autonomy and freedom in the work of Kant and Hegel, as well as more contemporary philosophers such as Korsgaard who are in dialogue with them. We will then consider how their theories of autonomy are complicated and expanded by Douglass and Fanon, before moving on to autonomy's contemporary critics from 'postmodern' and communitarian and religious perspectives. Themes examined will include putative links between autonomy and authenticity, between autonomy and secularity, and between autonomy and individualism.

How do we know what we (seem to) know about mathematics and morality? In metaphysics, these questions will include: What is time? What is the best account of personal identity across time?

PHIL 23206,"Negation, Limit, and Intentionality. 100 Units.","Issues attending the concepts of negation, limit, and intentionality (construed as thought's capacity to be answerable to reality) are typically approached in isolation one from another. The course will pursue the contrary hypothesis: namely, that the puzzles arising in connection with these three concepts form a nexus, so that none of them can be comprehended apart from the relations that it entertains with the two others. In order to motivate and substantiate this hypothesis, we will exhume and revive a philosophical tradition that runs from Plato to Wittgenstein through Kant and Sartre and whose defining feature lies in the upholding of this approach. We will examine how the three notions come into play in what Wittgenstein calls ""the mystery of negation"": ""This is not how things are, and yet we can say how things are not."" Bringing out their nexus requires accounting for the unity and univocity of the concept of negation across two ways of using negation that seem to pull in opposite directions: in the one case, ""not-p"" makes use of ""not"" in order to reject p as false (as in ""The shirt is not red""), which requires that p lies within the limits of the realm of the intelligible; in the other case, ""not-p"" makes use of ""not"" to reject p as nonsensical (as in ""The sweet is not a colour""), as if excluding p from the realm of the intelligible.

Starting from Descartes and the articulation of a general ""mind-body problem,"" we will go on to investigate particular mental phenomena (such as beliefs, emotions, sensations, and intentions) by considering what philosophers have said about them, drawing primarily from the 20th century and the analytic tradition.

Together we'll examine questions such as the following: What exactly is economics and what are its aims? Is the field defined by its subject matter or its methodology? Should positive economics be regarded as a value-neutral enterprise? Or does it inevitably need to make value-laden assumptions-about, for instance, rationality, well-being, distributive justice, etc.-that stand in need of justification? Should there be limits to what can be bought and sold on markets-and, if so, what should those limits be? Readings will include works by philosophers and economists. (A)",Autumn,,,Tyler Zimmer
PHIL 24503,Locke and Leibniz. 100 Units.,"This course will consist of a close study of Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding alongside Leibniz's chapter-by-chapter response to Locke in his New Essays on Human Understanding. Locke's Essay is the great manifesto and development of empiricism, and Leibniz's New Essays is a detailed, sustained rebuttal of Locke's book. As such, it is both a fascinating work by one of the giants of rationalism and a text that provides an opportunity to take seriously the idea that philosophy develops through dialogue. Topics to be discussed include innate ideas, necessary truths, reason, experience, substance, essence, personal identity, the nature of mind and body, and freedom, among others. We will also ask larger questions about the nature of the rationalist and empiricist traditions to which these philosophers belong - e.g., the extent to which empiricism is indebted to the experimental sciences, and whether rationalism is best understood as a doctrine concerning the sources of human knowledge or as a metaphysical claim about the intelligibility of being.

Foucault's views on power, knowledge, and genealogy were widely influential during his lifetime. Forty years after Foucault's death, interest in Foucault is once more on the rise. The purpose of this class is to provide a philosophical introduction to Foucault's ideas. Topics to be discussed include madness and social construction, the historical preconditions of knowledge, genealogical critique, reform's perilous potential, and the ""technologies of the self"".

The seminar begins by presenting Rousseau's political philosophy as a development of and a contrast to earlier social contract theories, in particular, to Thomas Hobbes's view. We then examine both Rousseau's and a few contemporaries' moral psychologies to determine whether the political philosophy that Rousseau favors is feasible and/or desirable.",,,,

PHIL 25798,"Substance in Medieval, Modern, and Contemporary Metaphysics. 100 Units.","The notion of substance has long been at the center of metaphysical theorizing. Substances are said to be fundamental and independent things, capable of existing on their own, which are the bearers of properties. An account of substance has also been thought central to metaphysics in that the primary sense of 'being' is the sense in which substances are beings. But there has been a great deal of controversy over how to give an account of the nature or being of substance, what sorts of things we should count as substances, what we can know of substance, and even whether the notion of substance is intelligible. In this course we will examine a number of influential accounts of substance in medieval, early modern, and contemporary metaphysics. Historical figures we will likely read include Aquinas, Scotus, Ockham, Suárez, Descartes, Spinoza, and Locke.

In this course we will explore various attempts in the history of philosophy to describe and produce such a science, beginning with Plato and Aristotle's attempts to describe being and ending with Wittgenstein's skepticism about such a project. We will try to produce a generalization about what first philosophy is and about its possibility and limitations. (B)",Winter,PHIL 36710,,Arnold Brooks
PHIL 27000,History of Philosophy III: Kant and the 19th Century. 100 Units.,"The philosophical ideas and methods of Immanuel Kant's ""critical"" philosophy set off a revolution that reverberated through 19th-century philosophy. We will trace the effects of this revolution and the responses to it, focusing specifically on the influence of Kant's contribution to moral philosophy and its lasting influence on discussions of ethics and political philosophy. We will begin with a consideration of Kant's famous Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, in which he announces his project of grounding all ethical obligation in the very idea of a free will. We will then consider Hegel's radicalization of this project in his Philosophy of Right, which seeks to derive from the idea of freedom, not just formal constraints on right action, but a determinate, positive conception of what Hegel calls ""ethical life"". We will conclude with an examination of some important challenges to the Kantian/Hegelian project in ethical and political theory: Karl Marx's re-interpretation of the idea of freedom in the economic sphere; Mary Wollstonecraft and John Stuart Mill's radicalizations of the ideas of political liberty and equality; and the appropriation and critique of the Enlightenment rhetoric of freedom by writers on racial oppression including Frederick Douglass, W.

Specific theories of the human have served as foundations of practices of dehumanization, and yet experiences of dehumanization have led to the development of new forms of humanism. In light of histories of enslavement and colonization and the related hierarchies of the human, what is the conceptual basis of the hierarchization within or exclusion from the category of the human? What does it feel like to be dehumanized and how does one adequately respond to such an experience? Some thinkers reject the concept while others reclaim it to inspire new existential outlooks on the world or political struggles. This course will explore the wide literature on these questions, supplementing written texts with other media such as film and music. We will focus on the implications of theories of humanism for the particularly human form of being, the pursuit of the good, and the organization of social life. Engagement in this course will be based on discussion, personal reflection, and the relation of course material to contemporary issues.",Winter,"RDIN 27543, PHIL 37543, RDIN 37543",,Kevin Irakoze
PHIL 27544,African Philosophy. 100 Units.,"This course is a general survey of African philosophy. We will read a selection of writings from African philosophers, spanning geographical space and historical periods. The tendency for the study of African philosophy is to focus solely on post-colonial writings with texts originally written in French or English. Against this tendency, the course will introduce students to a wider chronology of African philosophy that traverses various historical eras and with an attention to the diversity of the original languages of primary texts (including Ge'ez, Arabic, German, and Latin). In addition to often-studied figures such as Paulin Hountondji and Kwame Gyekye, we will engage with such thinkers as Ahmad Bābā al-Timbukti, Augustine of Hippo, Zara Yaqob, James Africanus Beale Horton, and Anton Wilhelm Amo. Instruction will emphasize the close reading of primary texts within relevant historical contexts. Students will be encouraged to engage African philosophy on its own terms and in conversation with other philosophical traditions.",Winter,RDIN 27544,This course is introductory and does not require any prior coursework in philosophy.,Kévin Irakóze

PHIL 29420,Non-Classical Logic. 100 Units.,"This course introduces non-classical extensions and alternatives to classical logic, and the philosophical debates surrounding them. Topics include modal logic (the logic of possibility and necessity), intuitionistic and many-valued logics (in which sentences may be neither true nor false, or both true and false), and relevant logic (which tries to refine the classical concept of entailment to capture the idea that the premises of arguments should be relevant to their conclusions). Students will learn tableau-style proof theories and Kripke frame semantics for a variety of non-classical logics, and will discuss adjacent philosophical issues, including the nature of necessity and possibility, the metaphysics of ordinary objects and fictional characters, the nature of truth, and the relationship between the world and the logical theories we use to describe it.

These are some of the questions that this course hopes to explore by following along the threads of a conversation that has united the aims, hopes, and disappointments of three generations of anti-colonial thinkers in the Afro-Atlantic world. Taking the intellectual life of the Jamaican-British social theorist, Stuart Hall, as an exemplary site for this investigation, students will engage with a variety of sources-recordings, interview transcripts, memoirs, scholarship, and political writings-in an effort to piece together one strand of conversation out of which Hall's intellectual life took shape and through which he in turn shaped the intellectual lives of others. Of particular interest here is the intergenerational character of these conversations. Students will be encouraged to explore how people are shaped by intergenerational preoccupations and concerns, even as they come to take up these preoccupations in new ways that often mark a break from the past. Together, we will also examine how, in narrating their own preoccupations and intellectual lives to themselves, people lay claim to particular pasts and sketch out hoped-for futures.",Spring,"FNDL 20928, CCCT 20928, PARR 20928, CRES 26511",,Daragh Grant

How do political parties represent diverse constituencies and demands? What is the relationship between a social movement and a political party? This seminar course will address these and other related questions, as we examine American political parties, representation, and the politics of ""identity"" in the United States. This course is designed to focus on the ways in which groups are represented in the American political party system; how inequality and marginalization are often entrenched and reinforced through political parties; and how political parties shape the mobilization of voters. We will pay particular attention to the ways in which race and ethnicity, gender and sexuality, class, religion and their intersections form the basis of what has come to be called ""identity politics"" by many pundits and politicians. In the first part of the course, we will engage an array of work in political science and other disciplines to learn about theories of representation, political power and collective action, and the structure and function of political parties, including how rules and reforms affect representation. We will also examine groups and identities as political and analytical concepts.

PLSC 22001,Writing about Complex Issues. 100 Units.,"This course will challenge students to engage critical questions of human security in the context of three contemporary case studies that have come to represent ""policy quagmires"" at the international level: international stabilization efforts in the Sahel region of Africa; the US-led ""War on Drugs"" in Latin America and the Caribbean; and the migration ""crisis"" in Europe. Students will be required to think critically about existing policy approaches pursued by various actors in these settings. Drawing from a range of sources and disciplines, students will learn how to analyze these issues, write persuasively in a variety of formats, and come away better equipped to research and write about other complex international crises. In all three case studies, the prevailing development-security nexus, promoted and financed by the international community and national governments, has proved insufficient as a framework for meeting respective challenges. Meanwhile, non-state actors, including criminal networks, armed groups, civil society organizations, NGOs, and humanitarian agencies compete and collaborate with state actors and each other to shape security and governance outcomes according to their own interests and ideologies.

Such actors have argued that tactics ranging from boycotts and civil disobedience to revolutionary violence and the general strike are democratic in both their ends and means. How should we understand the morality and efficacy of political (non)violence? What forms of organization are apt for articulating and channeling popular revolt? For containing its unintended consequences? How does the experience of political action transform the self and society? Students will engage these questions through careful reading of key thinkers and by developing research projects that investigate the theory and practice of political action in contemporary social movements.",,,,"Wang, Joy"
PLSC 22160,The Practice of Political Theory. 100 Units.,"This course will introduce students to several leading approaches in contemporary political theory as practiced in American political science departments. The courses' primary goal is to facilitate the study of the methodologies behind various approaches to political theory. In the course we will study the philosophical presuppositions that undergird various methods, some of the foundational texts in them, and more recent works that exemplify the approach. Ultimately, we will ask how we, as political theorists, might use and improve upon these methods in our own research, and what these methods can tell us about how political theory is practiced today. The course will include sections on history of political thought, critical theory, normative political thought, comparative political thought, and post-modernism among others. The course is designed to fulfill the MAPSS requirement for methods for students focusing on political theory. The course is open to undergraduates and non-mapss students by instructor's consent.

We will begin with Plato's depiction of Socrates' trial and imprisonment (Apology, Crito) before turning to dialogues reflecting on the use and abuse of rhetoric (Gorgias), the teachability of virtue (Protagoras), the nature of desire (Symposium, Phaedrus), and his trilogy on knowledge and its bearing on political rule (Theaetetus, Sophist, Statesman), before concluding with the death of Socrates in the Phaedo.

Is there more to learn about global interactions from history? The core evidence and theories of International Relations are entrenched in the history of the 20th century, especially in the wake of the World Wars. However, scholars have long identified 1648, or even as early as 1495, as the launching point for modern international relations. This course introduces the field of Historical International Relations and challenges students to think more broadly about global politics. Guided by major themes from International Relations such as world order, empire, and conflict, we will explore scholarship written with a historical perspective going back to the early modern period. We will see how historically-minded scholars critique, reconcile, and engage the field of IR while also unpacking the challenges presented by this type of scholarship.",Autumn,,,

PLSC 22677,"Latinxs, Labor, and the Law in the U.S. 100 Units.","Latinidad"" is an ethno-racial signifier meant to encompass people of Latin American descent living in the United States. Terms like ""Latina,"" ""Hispanic,"" and most recently, ""Latinx/e"" are meant to evoke a commonality that crosses nationalities to create political power & social recognition in the United States. Like every other identity term, ""Latinidad"" is an ever-contested construction with uncertain contours. The history of Latinidad in the U.S. has its origins in a myriad social efforts and forces: political campaigns, immigration policies, community organizing, migrant labor programs, union campaigns, marketing strategies, artistic expressions, & many more. Rather than simplify or ignore these tensions, the purpose of this class is to confront the agonistic aspects of Latinidad head-on. In this course, students will read widely across the social sciences & humanities, delving deep into the making and remaking of ""Latinidad"" in the U.S. We will be playing foremost attention to the roles that U.S. economic relations & government policies have had in shaping collective understandings of Latinidad, from the making of a ""brown collar"" labor sector sustaining the American economy to the development of census categories to describe Latinxs. Furthermore, we will look at U.S. Latinxs not merely as objects of policy, but also as subjects of politics, delving into the past and present of U.S. Latinx political life.",Autumn,RDIN 21677,,
PLSC 22913,Political Science Research Methods. 100 Units.,"This is a first course in empirical research as it is practiced across a broad range of the social sciences, including political science. It is meant to enable critical evaluation of statements of fact and cause in discussions of the polity, economy, and society. One aim is to improve students' ability to produce original research, perhaps in course papers or a senior thesis. A second objective is to improve students' ability to evaluate claims made by others in scholarship, commentary, or public discourse. The specific research tools that the course develops are statistical, but the approach is more general. It will be useful as a guide to critical thinking whether the research to be evaluated, or to be done, is quantitative or not. Above all, the course seeks to demonstrate the use of empirical research in the service of an argument.",Autumn,,,P. Conley
PLSC 23002,Ethics in International Relations. 100 Units.,"Ethical questions pervade international politics. Do affluent states have an obligation to make economic sacrifices to mitigate the progression of global warming? Are human rights universal? Should states waive the intellectual property rights of pharmaceutical companies to enable global access to vaccines? Can military intervention be justified despite its breach of sovereignty? Despite the frequent invocation of normative language in global politics, scholars of international relations have only recently started to turn their attention toward studying ethics as an important political phenomenon. This marks a shift away from considering ethics as epiphenomena to interests and power. This seminar explores the role of ethics in international relations, both in theory and in practice. It draws on readings from normative international relations theory and political philosophy to take up ethical dilemmas encountered in world affairs in the context of debates about the environment, humanitarian intervention, nuclear weapons, development, and global health.",Spring,"INRE 33000, PLSC 33002",,"Turco, Linnea"
PLSC 23005,Peace in International Relations. 100 Units.,"How has peace been theorized in the study of global politics? In this graduate elective, we take up the concept of 'peace' and explore the many ways it has been defined by scholars and pursued by policymakers and practitioners in the world. We consider questions like: Is peace the mere absence of war? How is peace experienced by individuals living in the aftermath of violent conflict? What are some of the markers of successful peace agreements? Who are agents of peace? How do states pursue peace? What is the relationship between peace and violence? Throughout the course, we will examine peace through multiple levels of analysis, including everyday individuals, elite policymakers, the State as actors, and international cooperative efforts. We will also explore various approaches to peacebuilding, including grassroots and top-down efforts, and pay careful attention to perspectives on peace and peacebuilding beyond Western, Eurocentric lenses. A key emphasis in this course will be connecting academic research to real-world applications of peace practices. As such, we will learn from both peace scholars and peace practitioners and will reflect throughout on the role of academia in understanding and building peace in the world.",Spring,"INRE 33005, PLSC 33005",,"Hooser, Kara"

How do we transform critical theory into praxis? This course returns to the roots of Frankfurt School Critical Theory to re-interrogate some of its foundational questions and ideas, before branching off into some of its lesser-studied trajectories. We will first engage with some of its sources in the works of Karl Marx and Georg Lukács, analyzing concepts like alienation and reification that will become central to the Frankfurt School, before examining core texts from Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, and others, that engage with questions of emancipation and the role of critique. Finally, we will examine its offshoots and contemporary legacies among thinkers like Angela Davis, Hans-Jürgen Krahl, Robyn Marasco, Eva von Redecker, and Rahel Jaeggi.",Winter,,,"Levine, Will"
PLSC 23220,Approaches to Authoritarian Politics. 100 Units.,"This seminar introduces students to the political science literature on authoritarian politics. Throughout the quarter we will situate authoritarianism in its broader historical context, engaging with scholarship on a diverse set of nondemocratic regimes, ranging from 20th-century fascisms to contemporary competitive authoritarianisms. Should we approach authoritarianism as a unique political regime or an experiment in political control? Why do some authoritarian regimes last for decades while others are quickly overthrown? What can authoritarianism teach us about propaganda, manipulation, and misinformation today? Students will engage with the writings of Hannah Arendt, Juan Linz, Barbara Geddes, Jennifer Gandhi, Jason Stanley, and Wendy Brown; alongside contemporary journalism, commentary, and fiction.

While some credit increased globalization with dramatic reductions in extreme poverty and rising standards of living, others see it as a new form of colonial domination driving environmental degradation and labor exploitation. In this course, we will examine these developments through the lens of labor. We will look at how workers and their unions have shaped, and been shaped by, the politics of globalization on issues ranging from tariffs to democratization and from fiscal austerity to climate change.

We will examine who runs for - and who wins - seats in Congress, the lawmaking processes in the House and Senate, and the roles of parties and leaders in the two chambers. We will take stock of changes in the operation of the House and Senate, focusing in particular on the problems associated with extended debate in the Senate and leadership selection in the House. We will then consider Congress's role as a policymaker. How does Congress make public policy? What factors inhibit legislative productivity? Who has input into the process? Finally, we will assess Congress's performance during periods of economic, cultural, and political turmoil. Is policymaking too partisan or too hard to do well? Is the public's disapproval of the first branch warranted?",,,,Ruth Bloch Rubin

Why did Latin American countries build weaker states than Europe and the US? What countries of the region are more developed and why? Why is Latin America the most unequal region in the world? Why have the democracies of the region been historically so vulnerable and ephemeral? Where and why did ethnic conflict appeared in the past decades? We will understand, evaluate, and discuss the seminal arguments and ideas on the origins and long-term evolution of Latin American nations. The course is of interest to students focused on economic development and international security, as the ""state"" and its capabilities have major consequences for the economic trajectory of nations and for the ability to guarantee peace within their territories. The syllabus is organized around major topics on comparative politics, such as colonial legacies, trade-led state-building, federalism, party systems, revolutions, industrialization, democratization, and ethnicity and citizenship. Through these topics, the students will learn about the political institutions of a variety of countries in the region from a historical perspective.

This violence is promoted by armed non-state groups such as drug trafficking organizations, guerrillas, militias, mafias, warlords, gangs, and vigilantes that have established subnational criminal governance regimes and dictate important parameters of social, economic, and political life. Through the state is frequently distant and negligent in areas controlled by these groups, it is never entirely absent. Many residents in territories dominated by these groups attend schools, visit health clinics, receive cash transfers, continue to vote and work in formal parts of the city.

Some are peaceful and have prospered, while some remain poor, war-torn, or both. What explains why some countries have succeeded while others remain poor, violent, and unequal? Moreover, fifty years on, a lot of smart people are genuinely surprised that these countries' leaders have not been able to make more progress in implementing good policies. If there are good examples to follow, why haven't more countries followed these examples into peace and prosperity? Finally, we see poverty and violence despite 50 years of outside intervention. Shouldn't foreign aid, democracy promotion, peacekeeping, and maybe even military intervention have promoted order and growth? If not why not, and what should we do about it as citizens? This class is going to try to demystify what's going on. There are good explanations for violence and disorder. There are some good reasons leaders don't make headway, bureaucrats seem slothful, and programs get perverted.

How do users of AI make sense of their evolving knowledge and expertise as they are integrating AI into their craft? And what are the effects of these sectoral and individual shifts for how wealth and power accumulate in society as a whole? This course invites students to explore answers to these questions by centering the everyday collaboration between learning machines and highly credentialed workers in five global industries, each of which has a strong footprint in Chicago: academic research, architecture, journalism, marketing, and urban planning. Drawing on readings from labor economics, science and technology studies, political economy, and economic anthropology, students will prepare to participate in five tabletop exercises, each of which will be hosted by a UChicago alum at their Chicago offices. Students will alternate between serving as collaborators in and observers of a workflow that features a current industry-specific protocol for human/AI integration. In small groups, and with the help of post-observation interviews of our site hosts, students will reflect on their dual experiences as participants and observers. This reflection will culminate in a final written project, in which students will judge their everyday experience with AI in the context of larger debates about AI's opportunities and dangers.",Summer,,,

What kinds of claims count as conspiracy theories? Are conspiracy theories, as a category, epistemically deficient or problematic in some other way? How should social scientists deal with the fact that some conspiracy theories seem true or plausible, while others seem patently ridiculous? We will also give conspiracy theorists a chance to ""talk back,"" reading diverse texts authored by conspiracy theorists themselves, ranging from the satirical to the deadly serious. How can we take conspiracy theorists seriously without overstating the coherence of many of their arguments? And, how can we best respond to the effects of genuinely harmful or prejudicial conspiracy theories in a way that does not uncritically affirm the authority of expertise or close off the possibility of external critique?

PLSC 28110,Lab and Field Experiments in Comparative Politics and Policy. 100 Units.,"Over the last several decades in what has become known as an ""experimental revolution,"" social scientists have used experimental designs to study the effects of interventions and policies. The growing popularity of experimental methodology gives researchers leverage on causal questions, and bringing these designs to the field helps to bring their research designs closer to the real social phenomena they seek to understand. In this course, we will study how these methods have been used to study politics and policy, with examples from Africa, Latin America, and India. We will ask what types of questions experiments can answer, and what types of things we can manipulate and measure. We will review design considerations, such as methods to account for treatment spillover, and randomization procedures. We will also read critiques of experimental methods and field experiments; students will discuss ethical considerations, and will consider tradeoffs to limitations of experimental designs in field settings.

Leaders make decisions based not only on the national interest, but on their beliefs, political interests, and competing policy priorities. Other actors - the public, advisors, politicians, bureaucrats, and societal interest groups - also constrain or otherwise impact decision-making. Peering inside the state at these numerous domestic actors is critical to understanding why states behave the way they do in international politics. This undergraduate seminar unpacks the influence of various domestic political actors on a country's international behavior. Each week, we will survey a subset of the International Relations (IR) literature on one of these kinds of actors, starting with leaders and the masses and concluding with bureaucracies and interest groups. Throughout the course students will learn about and discuss the implications of this research on longstanding debates in the study of IR, including democratic peace theory and audience cost theory.

PLSC 29185,The Promise and Pitfalls of Direct Democracy: Referendums and Initiatives in Representative Systems. 100 Units.,"The majority of representative democracies retain mechanisms of direct democracy: referendums and citizens' initiatives. These mechanisms are controversial. Supporters view them as rightfully restoring a role for citizens in collective decision-making. They point to U.S. states where voters have recently used Medicaid and abortion referendums and initiatives to bring public policy more in line with voters' preferences. Critics view these mechanisms as giving too large a role to uninformed voters and as sidestepping the important deliberative processes that happen in legislatures. These critics point to ""bad"" referendum decisions, such as the U.K.'s Brexit vote in 2016. In this course, we will study mechanisms of direct democracy from the ""top,"" exploring how party and legislative elites deal with direct democracy, and from the ""bottom,"" exploring how voters approach them, with an eye toward answering the question, are referendums and initiatives good for democracy?",Autumn,PLSC 39185,,"Stokes, Susan"

As such, we will cover a wide range of topics from the causes of terrorism to the characteristics, targets, and strategies of terrorist organizations, the motivations of suicide bombers, and states' responses to terrorism. Relying on case studies and quantitative data, we will explore and try to address questions such as: Why do some terrorist groups target indiscriminately, while others are more discriminate in their attacks? Why do some terrorist groups provide social services to their constituents when others do not? Why do some terrorist groups use women operatives while others mostly recruit men? Why do some counterterrorism policies succeed while others fail, and generate more terrorism?

Its normative commitments - publicity, reciprocity, equality, impartiality, restraint, and community - have motivated generations of transformational agents and become imprinted in the quotidian practices of international political life. In spite of or maybe because of multilateralism's presence, its critics have enlisted the social theories of their time to critique multilateralism as unworkably idealistic or cunningly reactionary. What explains the staying power of an institution that knows few allies and many enemies? This course explores the crisis of multilateralism by taking seriously the idea that the institution has survived by ritualizing its normative content without ever cohering as an institutional form. We will explore this dynamic by reading several moments of crisis through classic and current theory. We will discover how political, economic, and social crises animate theory, and how theory, in turn, leaves its mark on what crisis actors imagine to be possible. Students are invited to write in a public-facing format: open-ended peer dialogue; syllabus plus keynote lecture; or op-ed blog post plus link annotation. After collectively assembling a theory reference guide, they will each explore a crisis phenomenon and use the theoretical resources this course provides to illuminate the crisis for their audience.",Spring,"PLSC 39901, INRE 39900",,"Staisch, Matthias"

PSYC 23165,Multidisciplinary Perspectives on Morality. 100 Units.,"Morality is essential for societal functioning and central to human flourishing. It has evolved to facilitate group living, regulate social interactions, minimize aggression, and promote cooperation beyond kinship. We are motivated by morality because it is advantageous at the individual level -a non-zero-sum game. These moral concerns are not located in an abstract world characterized by ivory tower speculations. We are inherently and deeply social animals, and nearly all manifestations of morality involve, build upon, influence, and often govern our relationships with others. The ability to think and act in accordance with moral norms is a hallmark of our species. The course is organized into 9 weeks, covering specific topics in morality from a multidisciplinary perspective, including evolutionary anthropology, psychology (developmental, cognitive & social), cognitive neuroscience, and behavioral economics.",Autumn,"PSYC 33165, KNOW 33165",,J.

We will discuss these methods in the context of recent empirical papers in the field.",,,,
PSYC 25101,The Psychology of Decision Making. 100 Units.,"We constantly make decisions, determine our preferences, and choose among alternatives. The importance of our decisions range from ordering a meal at a restaurant to choosing what college to attend. How do we make such decisions? What are the rules that guide us and the biases that shape our decisions? What determines our preferences? What impacts our willingness to take risks? In this course we consider how the way we go about gathering information affects our judgment, and how the way we frame problems affects our perceptions and shapes the solutions to problems.

At the same time, relationships often go wrong. Why is it that some relationships flourish and others flounder? Throughout this course, we will attempt to answer this question, focusing almost exclusively on romantic relationships. We will chart the time-course of a relationship, from the initial spark of attraction to forming a committed relationship to understanding when and why (some) relationships break up. We will end with broader considerations of how relationships have changed for different groups of people and across history.",Autumn,,,L. Emery
PSYC 25500,Cognitive and Social Neuroscience of Aging. 100 Units.,"As the baby boom generation ages, the rising prevalence of aging-related cognitive decline has become a major challenge for individuals, families and society. However, not all cognitive systems are negatively impacted by aging, and aging also causes complex social and emotional changes. How does aging affect our brains and our minds, and are these changes inevitable? This seminar provides an introduction to the scientific literature of the aging mind, focusing on both normal and pathological (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) changes in late adulthood.

PSYC 25700,The Psychology of Negotiation. 100 Units.,"Negotiation is ubiquitous in interpersonal interactions, from making plans for a trip with friends or family, to determining working conditions with an employer, to managing international conflicts. In this course we examine the structure of different negotiations and the psychology that governs the processes and outcomes of a negotiation. For instance, we consider the role of perceptions, expectations, intuitions, and biases. We evaluate the role of information processing, modes of communication, and power in influencing a negotiated outcome. We see how the psychology of trust, reciprocity, fairness, cooperation, and competition can affect our ability to benefit from an exchange or contribute to the escalation of conflict. To better understand the dynamics of the negotiation process, we learn both through engaging in a variety of negotiation role-plays and relating these experiences to research findings.

However, we don't call all of these forms of communication (e.g., drawing, pantomime, pointing, etc.) ""language"". In this course, we will examine historical, academic, and personal notions of what counts as language, exploring the diverse ways humans communicate, and consider how these different how these different forms of conveying meaning might contribute to language. Throughout this quarter we will draw on research from a wide variety of established spoken and signed languages, gestural systems, artificial languages in the laboratory, and newly emerging languages in the world to build a framework of how humans create and use symbols to make meaning. Later in the course we will consider how these different symbols and forms of conveying meaning interact when getting language off the ground, in three different contexts: (1) at the level of the individual acquiring a language, (2) at the level of an individual or group creating language or language-like systems from scratch, and (3) at the level of a community, using and changing a language over generations.",Winter,,,C.

In this course, we will explore how we develop motor skills: from early fetal movements to crawling, walking, and running. Importantly, we will relate our motor abilities to the other skills they impact: How does learning to sit change the kinds of words we hear? How does crawling impact our perceptions of depth and motion? How does beginning to walk influence how children interact with their parents? What role does culture play in the early expression of various motor skills? Moreover, how are the cascading interactions between motor skills and other areas of development impacted by differences in motor development (caused by developmental delays or injury)? After discussing the timeline and importance of motor development in infancy and early childhood, we will cover how changes in motor ability - due to disease, acquired injury, and aging - affect individuals' social worlds and cognitive abilities. Overall, we will talk about studies that examine existing interrelations between motor skills and other abilities, as well as experiments that introduce interventions designed to shift motor abilities - and as a class, we will design and propose our own novel interventions.",Winter,,,M.

Investors of all types are seeking to align their values with their investments and every day we see more examples of companies being held accountable (either by themselves or by their stakeholders) for the social and/or environmental externalities of their operations. Through a combination of readings, case studies, class discussion and projects, the course provides an introduction to and overview of the impact investing landscape, the range of investment opportunities across asset classes, and the opportunities and challenges for investors seeking meaningful impact investment vehicles. Students will learn the entire impact investment process from deal sourcing, financial and programmatic due diligence, to investment structuring to monitoring financial and social returns. Led by an experienced practitioner and supplemented by guest speakers, this course will provide both an intellectual and experiential understanding of double-bottom-line investing.",Autumn,,Suggested prior coursework: PBPL 24751 The Business of Non-Profits and The Evolving Social Sector,Christa Velasquez
PBPL 24800,Urban Policy Analysis. 100 Units.,"Cities are sites of challenge and innovation worldwide. Dramatic new policies can be implemented locally and chart new paths for national policies. Five main approaches are compared: Leadership patterns: are business, political, or other kinds of leaders more important--and where, when, and why do these matter? Second do capitalism, or more recently, global markets, make specific leaders irrelevant? Third: leaders like mayors are weaker since citizens, interest groups, and media have grown so powerful. Fourth innovation drives many policy issues. Fifth consumption, entertainment, and the arts engage citizens in new ways. Can all five hold, in some locations? Why should they differentially operate across big and small, rich and poor neighborhoods, cities, and countries? The course introduces you to core urban issues, whether your goal is to conduct research, interpret reports by others, make policy decisions, or watch the tube and discuss these issues as a more informed citizen. Chicago, US and big and small locations internationally are considered; all methods are welcome.",Autumn,"SOCI 20120, GEOG 30120, GEOG 20120, SOCI 30120",,T. Clark

Empirical evidence from developing economies will be employed extensively paying special attention to the methods used.",Autumn,,,"Menendez, A."
PBPL 25595,Power and Development. 100 Units.,"This course offers a perspective on the role of power in the evolution of societies. First, we will study narratives of political economy of development, dominant until recently, which draw on explanations for what made Europe, and parts of North America, exceptional, such as their innovation, trade, culture, or institutions. Second, we will explore research by historians, anthropologists, and sociologists that challenged these narratives on the grounds that they silenced the role played by European military domination over the rest of the world in the rise of Europe; the rise of the ""West"" coincides with the exceptional use of power at a global scale to expropriate, enslave, and even replace other societies whose welfare is not even part of current GDP calculations. Third, we will explore institutions, historical processes, worldviews, socio-political traditions, and ideas in societies outside the so-called West, and how those have contributed to the history of human societies but also to the set of possible ideas and models for ""development."" One ambitious aim of the course is to make sense of how we got into the world of today while navigating this epistemic imbalance, beyond ""us"" vs. ""them,"" and through research and policies that do not carry the presumption of pitying, saving, or fixing as the main starting point.

PBPL 26308,Practicum: Pillars of Public Safety. 100 Units.,"This practicum course introduces students to hands-on social policy research in the service of a client. In two respects, the course will be distinct from a typical undergraduate course: (1) in the independence expected of students formulating and pursuing a research question; and (2) in working in the service of a client. The research project will be a group project. For those of you preparing to write a BA thesis in Public Policy or a related discipline, it should also help to inform your approach to defining and refining a research question, identifying methods, and conducting exploratory analysis. The course will give you introductory, hands-on experience in interviewing and analyzing public data, two research techniques relevant to many fields of academic research and much work outside the academy as well. An introductory course on statistics or data science will be helpful background. The client for our research projects is the Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago. Understanding our client's interests and priorities will require us to have an initial grounding in the history of Chicago, public/private partnerships in the city, and current public policy debates around public safety, which we will cover in the first two weeks of the course.",Spring,,,Robert Owens

Policing in the United States is in crisis. Ubiquitous video records of police-civilian interactions have changed the relationships among the police, the public, local political authorities, and the media. At the same time, policing itself is changing in profound ways. New technological capabilities have increased public expectations of transparency and efficiency in policing while raising concerns about privacy and due process rights. Local police have taken on an expanding portfolio of responsibilities, including presence in public schools, mental health crisis response, and counter-terrorism. This course will equip students to understand the issues at stake in the contemporary policy debates surrounding policing and the foundational scholarly knowledge underpinning those debates.

It is aimed at people who want to deploy these tools, either in business or policy, whether through start-ups or within a large organization. While this requires some knowledge of how these tools work, that is only a small part of the equation, just as knowing how an engine works is a small part of understanding how to drive. What is really needed is an understanding of what these tools do well, and what they do badly. This course focuses on giving you a functional, rather than mechanistic, understanding.

Working from both a historical perspective and an analysis of contemporary policy, we will use theoretical and empirical texts to explore questions of identity, otherness, and ethics, such as: what can the histories of schooling for Black and Native students reveal about the educational project of the nation? How does the notion of whiteness as property shape public presumptions about what makes a ""good"" school? How are taken-for-granted ideas about other vectors of identity such as class, disability, and language informed by racialized school policies?

In the context of the course, we will largely focus on the Black American experience, but will have space to consider Black fun globally as well as to draw connections and comparisons across all kinds of leisure activities. The study of Black America is largely oriented towards understanding and analyzing Black oppression and resistance. Very little intellectual attention has been given to Black leisure, fun, joy and play. This course does just that. We will ground our work in a wide range of literature with readings in the sociology of leisure, studies in space and place, Afrofuturism, recreation studies and beyond. We will work to understand and develop critical theoretical and conceptual frameworks for thinking through Black fun and leisure. Three big questions will motivate our work together: 1) These days I see a lot of social media commentary that joy is resistance or fun is resistance. We will ask ourselves: Is it? Does it have to be? Is it possible to separate anything that Black Americans do from our history of oppression and resistance? 2) What do we gain from studying fun and leisure that we can't gain elsewhere? Does it matter? 3) How can the study of fun be meaningful in a world full of despair?

These case studies will be used to discover how dance, and the dancing body, performs and problematizes appropriation.

RDIN 26260,Katherine Dunham: Politics in Motion. 100 Units.,"This course traces the creative, political, and scholarly legacies of Katherine Dunham (1909-2006), exploring the immeasurable impact of her career as a dancer, choreographer, anthropologist, activist, and creator of the Dunham Technique. Students will merge embodied practice with in-class discussions of theoretical texts, questioning the role of Black dance traditions of the 20th century in helping shape transnational and Black diaspora studies. In keeping with the geographic scope of Dunham's practice and research, we will engage Black dance and social movements of the Caribbean, Latin America, the United States, and beyond. Central concepts of performance ethnography, Caribbean studies, and Black feminisms will anchor an investigation of dance as an intellectual process and as social action. We will contemplate the methods of artist-activists and artist-scholars in traversing disciplines and foregrounding new fields of thought. This course will balance training with a certified practitioner in Dunham Technique with field studies, archival research, and short choreographic experiments while taking advantage of concurrent city-wide events celebrating Dunham's legacy.

Boal's Theatre of the Oppressed provides key strategies for collaboratively crafting dramatic narrative. These strategies challenge the conventional Aristotelian structure that privileges a single protagonist and subordinates other stories. Instead, Boal structures a poetics in which the ""spect-actor"" contributes their voice. Students will engage in devising and embodiment exercises in Image Theatre, Newspaper Theatre, Forum Theatre, and more, by interpreting texts, (e.g., religious texts, constitutional documents, or political manifestos), interrogating current events, exploring public narratives, and valuing diverse learning styles. Students will contextualize destinations for the course material according to the aesthetic and academic questions that they bring into the classroom.

They combined philosophical debate, criminal trials, committee meetings, and Senate procedure. Some were rowdy and acrimonious, while others were meticulously organized in advance, usually by the court. Some remain obscure, while others are the most thoroughly documented events in all ancient history and reveal in detail how the later Roman government operated.

Self-deception seems paradoxical because the very same agent is both the deceiver and the deceived. What must the self be like, such that this paradoxical behavior is possible? The seminar will first consider a variety of theoretical accounts of self-deception and related phenomena, drawn from a wide array of sources, that range from Freud and Sartre to contemporary analytic philosophy. We will then consider whether literary portraits of self-deception do a better job of revealing its key aspects. Finally, we will consider the original question, ""What must the self be like, such that self-deception is possible?"" as a religious and theological question that invites to think about self-deception functions in the lives of religious adherents.",Autumn,THEO 33023,,William Wood

RLST 23608,"Worshipping the God that Dances: Embodied Forms of Knowledge, Self, and Divinity. 100 Units.","Friedrich Nietzsche wrote, ""I would only believe in a god that knows how to dance."" This course will use Nietzsche's comment as a springboard for critical philosophical exploration of embodied theories of knowledge, reality, and the divine. Along the way, we will leverage the image of a 'dancing god' to interrogate philosophical and religious dichotomies in both Western and Eastern traditions (e.g., between sacred/profane, theory/praxis, transcendence/immanence, masculine/feminine). Some traditions have used the metaphor of dance to theorize about a god of dynamic becoming vs. a ""wallflower"" god of static being. Contemporary cognitive scientists, inspired by Buddhist philosophy, speculate that selfhood might resemble something like an embodied form of ""dance,"" rather than a substantial mode of existence. How, then, can the notion of a ""dancing god"" challenge orthodox, atemporal, or disembodied conceptions of God, reality, and human experience? In what ways does a practical 'knowing how' differ from a purely theoretical 'knowing that'-and how does this impact the meaning and purpose of religious life? Readings will include Nietzsche, Durkheim, William James, Charles Hartshorne, Michael Polanyi, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and others; no prior experience with the philosophy of religion is required.",Spring,,,Jesse Berger

Are our enemies truly malicious, or just misunderstood? How does a person become a monster, and how does a person avoid it? Why are some villains so compelling, and what does this say about the good life? Do Hollywood movies enrich or distort how we imagine and respond to real-world evil? Did Thanos do anything wrong? This course combines readings from philosophical classics and religious traditions with comparative analyses of villains in films from 101 Dalmatians (1956) and Jaws (1975) to The Dark Knight (2008) and Black Panther (2018).

Above all, what does it mean to reflect on these categories outside the parochial context of the Western world? This course explores these questions by introducing some of the literary cultures, philosophical traditions, religious poetry, and aesthetic theories of the South Asian subcontinent.

Augustine's citizenship and politics entails living out membership in either fellowship while commingled on earth with the other. Augustine analyzes Roman history and politics as well as the new religion first encouraged and eventually imposed in the wake of Constantine's conversion. We shall read the entire work in translation, attending to historical observations, political stances, and religious views. Augustine made arguments of his own but saved huge swaths of Varro and other otherwise lost sources to fashion his historical critique of Rome, social analysis, and many ultimately fresh views on matters like human sexuality in paradise and in heaven.

What, if any, effect does personal belief and faith have in directing political will? How does nonviolent resistance encounter the institutional realities of social advocacy? And lastly, in what ways are religious orientations challenged by globalized financial systems and power structures? The nonviolent religious philosophies of Howard Thurman and Daniel Berrigan will be contextualized within their respective Christian traditions and interreligious commitments. We will then encounter the challenge of Political Realism through the works of Reinhold Niebuhr and Samantha Power to interrogate the place of personal faith commitments within a pluralized society and the concrete realities of war, peace, and international conflict.",Spring,,,Foster Pinkney
RLST 25591,Never Forget? Memorialization and the Ethics of Memory. 100 Units.,"Philosopher George Santayana famously stated that ""those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."" This widely shared sentiment presupposes an uncomplicated responsibility to remember the past. Is memory, however, an unalloyed good? Can there ever be too much memory or even harmful memory? How do we commemorate past injustices? Do we ever have an obligation to forgive and forget? In this course, we will examine different conceptions of memory offered by religious thinkers, philosophers, and historians. We will then compare theories that articulate the basis for memorial norms, duties, and responsibilities. To conclude the course, we will use the theories canvassed in the first two parts to evaluate two contemporary memory issues: the debate over ""working-off-the-past"" (Vergangenheitsaufarbeitung) in relation to crimes perpetrated by Nazi Germany, and the legacy of the Civil War in the United States. By the end of this course, students will be able to address a wide array of moral problems related to memory, such as whether and how we should remember the dead, past atrocities, revolutionary triumphs, and terrorist attacks. There are no prerequisites for this course.",Autumn,,,Zachary Taylor

Having established a working vocabulary, a map of the sources, and some facility with the tools, we will proceed to complicate the boundaries between law and aggadah (non-legal tradition) in its various forms (aphorism, parable, narrative cycle, case-law, ethical instruction, and more.)

Students will put classics of the Indian and Western philosophical traditions into conversation with contemporary analyses of ""alternative facts"" and postmodern criticisms of absolute truth. Questions to be considered include: Are half-truths just another kind of lie, or stepping-stones to a more complex understanding? Is it even possible to tell ""the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth""? Is it morally permissible to mislead someone for their own good, or for a leader to deceive their citizens?

What is the relationship between religion and politics and what should the relationship between them be? How does religion help us make sense of politics? How does politics help us make sense of religion? In this course, we will draw on history, social science, philosophy, theology, and ethics in order to explore these questions. First, we'll consider the history of religion and politics in the United States, with readings including Locke and Jefferson on the separation of church and state, Danielle Allen and Tracy Smith on the Declaration of Independence, and Robert Bellah and Frederick Douglass on American civil religion. Then, we'll consider the ways Americans use religious ideas to inform their politics, from Jerry Falwell's arguments about the Moral Majority to Martin Luther King, Jr., James Baldwin, and Robert P. Jones on religion and race. Finally, we'll examine how politics shapes Americans' religious identities, from the Civil War as a theological crisis to current debates around political Islam in the United States.",Spring,,,Derek Buyan

RLST 28132,Science/Fiction/Theory. 100 Units.,"Science fiction has enjoyed an extraordinary and still growing resurgence in popularity over the last two decades - through literature, film, video games, and even universities, where it is the subject of ever more courses being taught. Why has science fiction become so popular? Does it express the anxieties of a way of life that can't be sustained, is in decline, and might soon end, in the face of intractable war, lurching financial crises, recurrent pandemics and unchecked climate change? Does it speak to the senses of radical hope and irreparable despair about the future that seem to characterize our time? If so, then science fiction today is grappling with traditionally theological themes: fate and finitude, immortality and the nature of divinity, the place of the human within a cosmic scale, and the possibilities for redemption and messianic rupture. This course will explore these themes by pairing sci-fi literature and film with readings in philosophy and social theory. Throughout, we will ask how science fiction's propensity toward the theological allows it to grapple with the unique forms of hope and despair in our time, and in times past.",,ANTH 22132,,Alireza Doostdar and Hussein Ali Agrama

In interviews, Lucas confessed he took bits and pieces from a variety of religious traditions to create the mythology of Star Wars. Through close readings of the films and primary texts from different religions, students will analyze these influences and evaluate how well the films hold these religious elements together. This course is not an in-depth study of any one religious tradition, but draws elements from different traditions to shed light on the portrayal of religion within Star Wars (i.e., the Force) and the metaphysical and moral themes found in the Star Wars films.

Yet in addition to its characters and worldbuilding, Dune also offers insightful portrayals of religion and explores religion's roles in society and culture. How do a community's ecological, economic, and political contexts shape their religious beliefs? In what ways do beliefs change or develop over time? Why are rituals such important parts of religious systems? How do stories about ""salvation"" and the ""end times"" shape communal identity, purpose, and behavior? In this course, we will ponder these and other questions by placing Dune in conversation with the Qur'an, the Bible, and other religious texts to see how the same dynamics are at play.

The core material, beyond the theoretical overview, will be largely limited to antiquity and early Christianity; but if students wish to write their papers on areas beyond this relatively narrow remit (in other religions, in the middle ages, modern or early modern periods), this will be positively encouraged!

How does this astounding assemblage of architecture, visual arts, landscaping, performance spaces and political arenas reveal transformations in cultural tastes and power arrangements over the centuries?

To respond we will range across media, from the bitingly satiric comedies and provocative tragedies of the seventeenth century (Molière, Racine), through royal edicts regulating colonial slavery and first-hand accounts of the 1789 Women's March on Versailles that upended the monarchy, and finally to cinematic depictions (from Jean Renoir to Sophia Coppola) and experimental palace installations by the world's leading contemporary artists (Jeff Koons, Anish Kapoor, etc.).

FREN 26333,La poésie maghrébine d'expression française. 100 Units.,"Depuis son émergence vers le milieu des années 1930, la poésie maghrébine d'expression française a accompagné les bouleversements politiques dans les trois pays du Maghreb et influencé la production romanesque des écrivains maghrébins. Dans les années 1960, des expériences collectives majeures - telles que la revue Souffles au Maroc - placent la poésie au centre du projet de renouvellement culturel dans la région. A la suite de ces dynamiques de groupes, les poètes maghrébins développent des œuvres poétiques ancrées dans leurs expériences individuelles mais désormais ouvertes sur le monde. Des thématiques récurrentes telles que l'exil, l'errance, le désir de révolte et la quête de la liberté mobilisent des techniques poétiques aussi variées que la violence linguistique, le dialogue avec les mythes ou encore l'utilisation des ressources de l'oralité. En étudiant un corpus d'œuvres poétiques choisies du Maroc (Abdellatif Laâbi, Tahar Ben Jellou, Rachida Madani, Saïda Menebhi), de l'Algérie (Jean Sénac, Kateb Yacine, Assia Djebar) et de la Tunisie (Albert Memmi, Amina Saïd, Tahar Bekri), ce cours présente une introduction générale à la poésie maghrébine d'expression française.

Souvent, l'écriture de soi a donné lieu à une (ré)écriture de l'Histoire, mettant l'individuel et le collectif en dialogue permanent. L'autobiographie, par exemple, devient le champ d'une exploration simultanée des identités individuelle et collective, le lieu d'un témoignage littéraire autour de l'expérience coloniale et de ses conséquences, ou encore de la confrontation entre le poids persistant de la tradition et le désir de liberté et de changement. En se racontant, l'écrivain maghrébin restitue les tensions qui hantent l'espace et la mémoire partagés tout en proposant des voies de reconstruction à travers la révolte, le désir, et le travail de la langue. En s'appuyant sur un corpus d'œuvres marquantes de la littérature maghrébine d'expression française (Albert Memmi, Driss Chraïbi, Kateb Yacine, Assia Djebar, Fatima Mernissi, Abdellatif Laâbi), ce séminaire sera consacré essentiellement à la question du rapport entre écriture personnelle et écriture de l'Histoire dans un contexte maghrébin.

Si les pays du Maghreb ont vécu ces soulèvements et leurs conséquences de manières différentes, les écrivains maghrébins ont été particulièrement sensibles à l'élan et à la promesse de changement portés par la rue.

The variety of possible attitudes is wide and ranges between two extremes: the shame for the poetic gesture and the pride of reaffirming its importance. This survey course explores chronologically how these reactions are embodied by poetic postures that go range from the poet as idol (D'Annunzio) to the poet who is ashamed of his own verses (Gozzano), from the playful clown (Palazzeschi) to the sleepwalker (Sbarbaro).

The authors we will study were often active members in the movements of Futurism and Surrealism, and they applied these movements' aesthetic theories to their artifacts for children. Thus it is that in the calculated naiveté of this literary genre, we encounter elements of high sophistication, such as language games that subvert the existing order of things, research on spatial dynamism, and the exploration of nonlinear narrative. We will use children's literature to explore the avant-garde, and the avant-garde to better understand children's literature. We will begin with Iela Mari and Bruno Munari, who both challenged the nature of what constitutes a book, removing its primary function as an object that frames textual information, and instead transforming it into a visual and tactile object. We will then move to Toti Scialoja's non-sense infused poems and to Gianni Rodari's ""Grammatica della fantasia,"" a theoretical exposition on the uses of imagination.

ITAL 23205,Food and Culture in Italian Literature. 100 Units.,"The word ""culture"" is etymologically derived from the notion of cultivating the land, which evokes an act of care as well as of laboring. In this course we will explore this intrinsic link between food and culture in the Italian social context by analyzing a selection of literary works that tackle questions of identity, tradition, and the creation of a sense of belonging through the thematic thread of food. Bridging geopolitics, history, and environmental humanities, with a particular attention to animal ethics and gender studies, we will embark on a journey across time, geographical regions, and social classes, to understand the role of food in Italian culture beyond its symbolic and aesthetic value. We will ask: how have culinary practices and consumption changed over time? How does Italian literature engage with questions of food justice and sustainability? How do representations of food reproduce and thus perpetuate harmful hierarchies of class, gender, race, and species? Together, we will look for answers to these and other related questions in a wide range of texts by authors such as Boccaccio, Giovanni della Casa, Clara Sereni, Italo Calvino, and Carlo Levi. We will also examine artworks born out of food labor movements, such as the protest songs of the mondine, and contemporary literature by migrant writers.

To enlighten the baroque's emphasis on verbal/visual contamination, we will read passages from Emanuele Tesauro's Il cannocchiale aristotelico and Panegirici, particularly those dedicated to the Holy Shroud of Turin, which the baroque saw as an exceptional hybrid (representation made with Christ's blood). We will read the first chapter of Marino's Dicerie sacre (La Pittura. Diceria prima sopra la Santa Sindone), selections from Basile's Lo cunto de li cunti, and Torquato Accetto's Della dissimulazione onesta. From the modern Neo-baroque, we will read texts that reflect the concepts and rhetorical strategies we found in the seventeenth-century texts. We will analyze crucial novels such as Gadda's La cognizione del dolore, Ortese's Il cardillo addolorato, Manganelli's Dall'inferno, Discorso dell'ombra e dello stemma, and Centuria. We will focus on Sanguineti's Laborintus and Zanzotto's La beltà, which is a key text of Italian poetic canon.

Inizieremo ripercorrendo il pensiero di Elias Canetti, che senza sosta ha esplorato il concetto di sopravvivenza, specialmente nel suo intreccio col potere. Proseguiremo poi considerando come, nell'era dello sterminio di massa, la sopravvivenza si separi dal legame col potere e il trionfo e si leghi invece alla vergogna di chi resta in vita e al debito nei confronti dei morti. Affronteremo questo aspetto del problema attraverso un close reading dei testi di Primo Levi, che ci porteranno a riflettere sul rapporto tra sopravvivenza e testimonianza. La parte conclusiva del corso sarà dedicata emblematicamente a Anna Frank e alle appropriazioni e trivializzazioni postume della sua figura.",,ITAL 32710,,M. A. Mariani
ITAL 23822,The Renaissance of Emotions. 100 Units.,"Do emotions have a history? What are the relationships between thinking and feeling, between emotion and literary style? How do Italian texts construct or complicate our modern understanding of emotions? Students in this course will learn how emotions are described, analyzed, and represented in Renaissance and modern Italian literature, tracing their history and developments from the early 1500s to the late 1800s. Though the study of affects emerged in the late twenty-first century, an analysis of the passions (""hope,"" ""shame,"" ""desire"") dates back to the poets of Trecento Italy, and Machiavelli famously shows how emotions play a role in establishing socio-political hierarchies. We will examine in what ways Italian writers, poets, and philosophers approached the study of emotions and how they laid the foundations for understanding them today as aesthetic, psychological, and sociopolitical phenomena that vary across time and cultures. Readings will include works by Dante, Boccaccio, Niccolò Machiavelli, Leonardo da Vinci, Torquato Tasso, Giambattista Vico, and Giacomo Leopardi, among others, and will span from poetry and novel to philosophical and political fictions, letters, and autobiography.",,,,Beatrice Fazio
ITAL 24100,Goldoni. 100 Units.,"This class is a close reading (in context) of some selected works by Carlo Goldoni, Italy's most prominent playwright of the eighteenth century. It includes discussion of Goldoni's so-called ""reform"" of Italian theater, whereby elements of Renaissance and Baroque comedy where refashioned to serve a prototypical bourgeois theater; and Goldoni's antagonism with Carlo Gozzi, promoter of a more exotic yet old-fashioned type of comedy. In the latter part of the course we will focus on the Goldoni-Renaissance in the twentieth century, spearheaded by renowned stage director Giorgio Strehler (1921-1997).",,"TAPS 28420, ITAL 34100",,R.

ITAL 24410,Vichianism: The Italian (Counter-) Enlightenment. 100 Units.,"This course looks at the reception of Giambattista Vico (1668-1744), whose philosophy, largely neglected at first, eventually came to enjoy far-reaching influence as European thinkers set out on repeated quests for the source of a different ""modernity"" or ""Counter-Enlightenment"" in fields as varied as political theory (Romagnosi, Cattaneo, Ferrari), the historical and modernist novel (Cuoco, Manzoni, Joyce), Romantic historiography (Michelet, Gioberti), literary criticism (Auerbach), and intellectual history (Berlin). What is the secret behind the enduring appeal of Vico's anti-rationalist stance? This seminar, going further than dedicating itself to the legacy of a single thinker, wishes to investigate the ""logic"" (or lack thereof) that attends posthumous acclaim, eponymity, and etiological myths, and to provide guidelines for a disciplined approach to the history, practice, and theory of reception.",,ITAL 34410,,R.

Partendo dal Cantico del gallo silvestre, nelle operette morali, si cercherà di mettere in duscussione l'idea completamento negative del ""pessimisno leopardiano"". Si mosterà un percorso di pensieri leopardiani dove la negazione e le ""vedute pessimistche"" fanno parte d'un lungo discorso antropologico.

ITAL 24910,Italo Svevo. 100 Units.,"Visceralmente amato da Coetzee, Canetti e Perec - e prima ancora da Joyce e Montale, Italo Svevo potrebbe sembrare a tutti gli effetti un ""writer's writer."" Eppure è molto di più, perché anche il lettore comune è presto spinto a simpatizzare con questo autore dagli esordi sfortunati, costretto a pagare da sé la pubblicazione dei propri romanzi e incline a trattare l'italiano come una lingua straniera, rivoluzionandone la sintassi e il lessico. In questo corso introduttivo leggeremo tutte le sue opere, privilegiando la Coscienza di Zeno e addentrandoci anche nel romanzo postumo - Le confessioni del vegliardo - che celebra i borbottii della vecchiaia e descrive lo stupore della vita inghiottita dalla scrittura. Durante il corso porteremo spesso in primo piano lo sfondo filosofico delle pagine di Svevo, valorizzando in particolare gli elementi nietzschiani che vi sono disseminati: l'esaltazione dell'arte come potenza del falso e la scoperta del carattere di menzogna inseparabile dalla conoscenza.",,ITAL 34910,,M.

ITAL 24930,Italy and the Bomb. 100 Units.,"A new form of literature, ""indispensable for those who know and do not close their eyes"" (Elias Canetti), was supposed to have emerged from the contemplation of the harrowing ruins of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This new literature was supposed to have been a form of reconciliation; and it should have been able to engender, with its rhetorical devices, an antidote against the human instinct of destruction. This is the kind of literature that Elsa Morante calls for in her lecture ""For or Against the Atomic Bomb"", in which she chooses to tackle such a ""gloomy topic"", and yet one that ""nobody should dare ignore""-nobody, and especially not a writer. During our course we will read essays and novels written throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s that faced the issues posed by the atomic bomb. We will privilege Italian works, but we will also be attuned to the echoes of these themes within a global literary context. Topics to be investigated include the writer's ethical response, the scientist's responsibility and dilemmas, the spreading of apocalyptic fear, and the specter of humanity's death drive. Readings include texts by Italo Calvino, Elsa Morante, Alberto Moravia, Leonardo Sciascia, Hannah Arendt, Jacques Derrida, Günther Anders, Hans Jonas, among others.",,ITAL 34930,,Maria Anna Mariani

ITAL 25210,Brevitas. 100 Units.,"Reflecting on his preference for short literary forms, Italo Calvino identifies brevitas as ""the true vocation of Italian literature, which is poor in novelists but rich in poets, who even when they write in prose give their best in texts where the highest degree of invention and thought is contained in a few pages."" Taking as a starting point Calvino's statement, this course explores the short and fragmentary forms of Italian literature. Not only short stories, but also aphorisms, epigrams, lyrical fragments, cases, and apologues. Some of our guiding questions will be: What are the resources of expressive density? Is a fragment the negation of a superior unity or the compendium of an entire universe? How does silence shape brevitas? The moments of close reading and theoretical reflection will be alternated with creative writing activities, in which students will have the opportunity to engage more closely and actively with the encountered texts. This course is especially designed to help students improve their written Italian and literary interpretive skills.",,,,Maria Anna Mariani

As philosophers, theologians, poets, and narrators, Bruno and Campanella embody the literary, religions, and philosophical syncretism of the Italian Renaissance. To study these authors necessarily entails a close analysis of Florentine Neo-Platonism, Hermetism, magic, and apocalyptism, along with the literary traditions that molded the Italian renaissance. We discuss Bruno's Italian Dialogues, De umbris idearum (his first major treatise on artificial memory), and a selection of his later Latin poems.

There are other views of Dostoevsky, however. In Russia, more attention has been paid to his faith in Orthodox Christianity, which he believed could resolve the intense conflicts that dominate his novels, and to his view that the Russian national character might have the power to unite humanity under universal values. In this course we will read the novel Demons against the backdrop of these ideas, but also in the context of contemporary Russia, where notions of national destiny and sovereign ideals have been used to justify repression and invasion.

Entangled in an ongoing battle with basic philosophical tenets and, indeed, with existence itself, this erudite Polish author is a prime example of a 20th century modernist whose philosophical novels explode with uncanny laughter. In contrast to many of his contemporaries, who established their reputations as writers/philosophers, Gombrowicz applied distinctly literary models to the same questions that they explored. We investigate these models in depth, as we focus on Gombrowicz's novels, philosophical lectures, and some of his autobiographical writings.

An analysis of the rhetoric and historiosophy of the modern Russian elite will reveal the sources they been drawn upon. Is there a connection between Muscovite Russia, the Russian Empire and modern Russian neo-imperialism? What role does the legacy of the USSR play in the political system, state structure and foreign policy of the modern Russian Federation? Where do historical trends, national interests and the new imperial ideology coincide and contradict each other?

REES 27007,Mapping Our Selves: Identity and Subjectivity. 100 Units.,"This course examines how different collective and individual selves develop, change, and get mobilized in modern Eastern and Central Europe. As Enlightenment, post-Enlightenment, and national ideas spread across Europe, the understanding of self and subjectivity was fundamentally transformed. In Eastern and Central Europe, themselves terms that have their roots in these changes, this occurred at a tumultuous time of changes of borders, countries, and forms of government. This course focuses primarily on cultures and literatures in Poland's different forms of existence and non-existence, a locus central to these dynamics. We will ask such questions as: What does it mean to develop a sense of a nation without a territorial state or within an empire? What kind of subject do different works of art elicit and why? Under what circumstances does identity become a more engaging understanding of the self? What are its borders and porousness? We will be reading a variety of literary, artistic, and theoretical works from the 18th to 21st centuries, among them Immanuel Kant on Enlightenment subjectivity, Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau on the form and future of Poland, Karl Marx on base and superstructure, and Louis Althusser on the dynamics of getting drawn into a society and economic system (interpellation); as well as Polish authors probing these issues and tensions, such as Witkacy, Eliza Orzeszkowa, Andrzej Stasiuk, Debora Vogel, and Stanisław Brzozowski.",Winter,REES 37007,,Dag Lindskog
REES 27025,The Cracks of Being: Polish Modernist Literature. 100 Units.,"The Cracks of Being: Polish Modernist Literature. The 19th and early 20th centuries were characterized by radical changes: trains, cameras, telephones, industrialization, democracy. Moreover, objectivity appeared to be undermined by our unconscious, making for an increased doubt and suspicion toward being. ""All that is solid melts into air,"" Karl Marx wrote, and many would-be truths seemed to unmoor. On the other hand, modern life came with a sense of alienation and disenchantment in our increasingly mediated experience. Straddling this chasm, modernist literature has used many different strategies to make literary modern existence; and these are the focus of this course. Some authors try to salvage form, others attempt to mimic this instability, or represent the impossibility of representation. Our authors look for liminalities, epiphanies, cracks and nooks of being and language, in order to sound out, defamiliarize and re-present reality. The authors we will read include Bolesław Leśmian, Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz, Zofia Nałkowska, Bruno Schulz, Czesław Miłosz, and Witold Gombrowicz.",Spring,REES 37025,,Sasha Lindskog

Readings include primarily short fiction in a variety of genres (sentimental, romantic, realist, and gothic) by canonized male writers and by women writers of the 19th Century who are less often taught and translated, but were widely read in their own day. These works expand our understanding of the narrative possibilities for sexuality and gendered subjectivity in the Russian literary sphere, and of the ways in which possibility itself was made and remade by literary expression.

After all, shadows are cast by things and people…. Do you want to strip the earth of all the trees and living things just because of your fantasy of enjoying naked light?"" asks the Devil. Mikhail Bulgakov worked on his novel The Master and Margarita throughout most of his writing career, in Stalin's Moscow. Bulgakov destroyed his manuscript, re-created it from memory, and reworked it feverishly even as his body was failing him in his battle with death. The result is an intense contemplation on the nature of good and evil, on the role of art and the ethical duty of the artist, but also a dazzling world of magic, witches, and romantic love, and an irresistible seduction into the comedic. Laughter, as shadow and light, as the subversive weapon but also as power's whip, grounds human relation to both good and evil.

In 2010, The Economist published an article entitled ""The Rich, the Poor, and Bulgaria,"" in which Bulgaria bucked the paradigm of predicted correlation between income and happiness. ""The saddest place in the world, relative to its income per person,"" the Economist reported, ""is Bulgaria.""

REES 29646,Tutorial - Science and Literature in Twentieth Century Russia. 100 Units.,"This course examines the interactions between the science and literature of late Imperial Russia and the early Soviet Union. The relationship between sciences and humanities is difficult to disentangle. Are they antithetical, or allies? Disparate or proximate? The possibilities that science offers for literature, and literature for science, are exemplified in their interactions in Russia. The dynamic culture of the waning Empire and the turbulence of the nascent Soviet Union are captured in the literature of the early 20th century, as authors and scientists contend with the social and political upheaval. Literature embodies the engagements between science and humanities, inspiring, reflecting, and reinterpreting scientific aspirations. Readings will be balanced between primary fictional texts, including novels, short stories, plays, films, and poetry, and secondary scholarship on the history of science. Authors include Mikhail Bulgakov, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Anna Akhmatova, and more, while we will explore Cold War and contemporary historiography though scholars such as David Joravsky, Loren Graham, and Nikolai Krementsov.",Spring.

REES 29902,The Time of Death. 100 Units.,"This course is designed to meet the specific needs of a student in the College, an advanced learner of Serbian language and culture, double majoring in Economics and REES. The curriculum of this one-quarter class focuses on the literary work of 20th-century Serbian writer Borislav Pekić. Through a close reading of his first novel, The Time of Miracles (1965), we plan to uncover not only Pekić's notable artistic skills, but also the variety of his linguistic devices- ranging from highly ornate imitations of biblical diction to expressions bordering on urban slang-adjusted to depict the historical and cultural context of his era. In the novel the Christian myth becomes a vehicle for exposing the moral hypocrisy, cruelty, and futility of modern myths, especially those built around the Communists' ideal of their own ""promised land."" The inevitable flatness of allegorical presentation is always counterbalanced by an enormous vividness of realistic detail, while implied irony makes this somber book surprisingly light-thus it showcases hallmarks of Pekić's unique style.",Winter,,,Nada Petkovic

This course will explore how (dis)information about the virus and pandemic is created, disseminated, and shapes our perceptions, with a particular focus on narratives and aesthetics within a variety of information ecosystems. We will explore, in a broadly chronological format, important narratives and iconography that emerged and continue to evolve during the course of the ongoing pandemic and that contribute to our individual and collective understanding of social, cultural, political, and scientific aspects of the pandemic. We will further consider how this information relates to personal and collective knowledge formation that subsequently informs our attitudes about and behaviors during the pandemic.

We'll ask about the importance of social origins (parent social status, race/ethnicity, gender, and language) in predicting labor market outcomes. We'll study the role that education and plays in shaping economic opportunity, beginning in early childhood. We'll ask at what points interventions might effectively advance learning and reduce inequality. Second, we'll gain mastery over some important statistical methods required for answering these and related questions. Indeed, this course provides an introduction to quantitative methods and a foundation for other methods courses in the social sciences. We consider standard topics: graphical and tabular displays of univariate and bivariate distributions, an introduction to statistical inference, and commonly arising applications such as the t‐test, the two‐way contingency table, analysis of variance, and regression. However, all statistical ideas and methods are embedded in case studies including a national survey of adult labor force outcomes, a national survey of elementary school children, and a national survey that follows adolescents through secondary school into early adulthood.

SOCI 20192,The Effects of Schooling. 100 Units.,"From at least the Renaissance until some time around the middle of the twentieth century, social class was the pre-eminent, generalized determinant of life chances in European and, eventually, American societies. Social class had great effect on one's social standing; economic well-being; political power; access to knowledge; and even longevity, health, and height. In that time, there was hardly an aspect of life that was not profoundly influenced by social class. In the ensuing period, the effects of social class have receded greatly, and perhaps have even vanished. In their place formal schooling has become the great generalized influence over who gets access to the desiderata of social life, including food, shelter, political power, and medical care. So it is that schooling is sociologically interesting for reasons that go well beyond education.

Over time, individuals and groups of people change places. In the long run, the places themselves move in physical, social, economic and political space. These movements can be characterized by their origins and destinations, as intentional or accidental, forced or voluntary, individual or collective, within political borders (e.g. the farm-to-city migration of the 1940's in the U.S), migration across political boundaries (e.g. ""displacement"" of pariah ethnicities after World War II), and by other criteria. All of these phenomena are aspects of migration This course reviews contemporary demographic research and theory concerning the nature of migration, and its extent, causes and consequences for individuals and collectivities.

Further, wealth data conveys less information than income data about the lives of the middle- and lower-classes -- who tend to have little or no wealth at all. However, information about wealth gives fundamentally important insight into the values, attitudes, behavior, consumption patterns, social standing, political power, health, happiness and yet more characteristics of individuals and population subgroups.

What impact do they have on U.S. society? Are today's immigrants fundamentally different from previous waves of immigrants? Are these immigrants assimilating to the U.S. or retaining their culture? Why do some immigrant groups appear to fare better than others? This course will expose students to the latest social science research on contemporary immigration to the United States. We will explore its origins, adaptation patterns, and long-term effects on American society.",Autumn,CRES 20282,,R. Flores

SOCI 20547,Involved Interviewing: Strategies for Interviewing Hard to Penetrate Communities and Populations. 100 Units.,"Imagine that you must interview someone who hails from a background unlike your own; perhaps you need to interview an incarcerated youth, or gather a life history from an ill person. Maybe your task is to conduct fieldwork inside a community that challenges your comfort level. How do we get others to talk to us? How do we get out of our own way and limited training to become fully and comfortably engaged in people and the communities in which they reside? This in-depth investigation into interviewing begins with an assumption that the researcher as interviewer is an integral part of the research process. We turn a critical eye on the interviewer's role in getting others to talk and learn strategies that encourage fertile interviews regardless of the situational context. Weekly reading assignments facilitate students' exploration of what the interview literature can teach us about involved interviewing. Additionally, we critically assess our role as interviewer and what that requires from us. Students participate in evaluating interview scenarios that are designed to explore our assumptions, sharpen our interviewing skills and troubleshoot sticky situations. We investigate a diversity of settings and populations as training ground for leading effective interviews. The final project includes: 1) a plan that demonstrates knowledge of how to design an effective interviewing strategy for unique field settings; 2) instructor's feedback on students' interview journals.",Autumn,"SOCI 40164, MAPS 40164",Ugrad Level restricted to 4th and 3rd year Sociology Majors ONLY,S.

SOCI 20548,Coding & Analyzing Qualitative Data using MAXQDA. 100 Units.,"This focus of this course is on coding and analyzing qualitative data (e.g., interview transcripts, oral histories, focus groups, letters, and diaries, etc). In this hands-on-course students learn how to organize and manage text-based data in preparation for analysis and final report writing of small scale research projects. Students use their own laptop computers to access one of two free, open-source software programs available for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. While students with extant interview data can use it for this course, those without existing data will be provided text to code and analyze. This course does not cover commercial CAQDAS, such as AtlasTi, NVivo, The Ethnograph or Hypertext.",Spring,"MAPS 40177, SOCI 40177",Ugrad Level restricted to 4th and 3rd year Sociology Majors ONLY,S.

SOCI 20575,Logic of Social Inquiry. 100 Units.,"This course is intended to cultivate deeper thinking about research practice. We will talk about different methods of sociological research, quantitative and qualitative, including surveys, interviews, systematic observation, and archival research. In particular, we will discuss the logic underlying each method, exploring questions such as What kind of data can we get at using this method? How do we know our findings are valid? To what extent are they generalizable? On what basis can we make causal inferences? Is my research ethical? and How does my positionality matter? In addition to research logic, our other focus will be on research design. Here we want to get students to think about the many choices they have to make in pursuing a research project; choices about what aspect of reality to focus on and how to construct a research question in order to get at it, which methods to employ, and which case(s) to investigate. We see this course as a necessary bridge between theory and research, believing that good sociology lies precisely in the ability to bridge this gap. Suffice it to say, it will better prepare students to write an academic paper for their capstone projects. We recommend that sociology majors take the course in their third year.",Winter,SOCI 30575,,T. Huttenlocher
SOCI 20596,Social Networks. 100 Units.,"Our social ties and interpersonal connections both reflect and influence our preferences, attitudes, decisions, and relationships. This makes a relational perspective a core component of many sociological theories and social network analyses a powerful tool for social scientists. This class will provide students with an introduction to social networks analyses and theory, overviewing tools for describing and analyzing personal and whole networks. Possible applications include discussions on how and why interpersonal networks differ from each other across different social contexts, how such networks have changed over time, and what this means in increasingly diverse societies: when can we expect networks to build bridges between groups and offer opportunities, and when can we instead expect them to exacerbate inequality and reinforce social divides? Alongside theoretical discussions, this class will also introduce students to quantitative social networks analyses using R. As a part of the methodological component of this course, we will analyze data on several kinds of example networks, with a focus on offline person-to-person connections (such as school friendships and confidant networks). At the completion of the course, students will apply the concepts covered in class to a final project. Prior coding experience and introductory statistics course is recommended but not required.",Spring,SOCI 30596,Prior coding experience is suggested but not required,L. Zhao
SOCI 20599,The Logic and Methods of Historical Research. 100 Units.,"This seminar introduces students to some of the major epistemological and methodological challenges confronting qualitative historical research in the social sciences. It is divided into two parts. The first half tackles key issues regarding the logic and reasoning of historical research, including causality, contingency, temporality, narrativity and the use of comparisons. The second half delves into the practical and minute complexities of historical research methods - particularly archival research and oral histories - and their epistemological roots. This seminar is NOT a substantive introduction to the vast body of work produced under the rubric of comparative historical sociology and historical social sciences, but rather familiarizes students with problems concerning the ""logic of historical inquiry"" as well as equips students to conduct actual historical research.",Winter,SOCI 30599,,Y. Zhang
SOCI 20604,Political Religion and Sociology. 100 Units.,"In the era of post-secularism (with the reappearance of religion in the public arena), the contemporary world has witnessed the formation and growth of political religion approaches. Political religion has two aspects: a religion that is politicized (with non-political roots) and another with a political identity. Both elements of political religion, both in monotheistic and non-monotheistic religions, have significantly impacted the formation of movements, organizations, and fundamentalist approaches that have faced the modern world with serious challenges (especially in terms of national identity and security). The main problem of the current era of political religion is its characteristics, the roots of its formation and its different representations from a sociological perspective, and how to observe and analyze the representations of political religion even in our daily and ordinary lives.",Winter,SOCI 30604,,"Khoshk Jan, Z."
SOCI 20605,The sociology of revolution in the contemporary world. 100 Units.,"The modern world is a complex world of technology, media, the internet, the economy, international relations, etc.. As time goes by, these complexities increase even in human relations. One of the complex and critical issues is the issue of revolution as the most radical form of the relationship between a government and the social-political forces of society. The contemporary world is full of surprises, and one of the most radical surprises is the occurrence of the revolution in an unexpected context. But there is no surprise because, Like the human body, society has warning mechanisms that ignoring by a government can cause it to be overthrown. In this course, we will investigate these alarms and conditions that can lead to revolution or any other challenging social practice by actioners and determine the answers to these critical questions: What are the differences between revolution, movement, coup, and rebellion? How can their occurrence be predicted and analyzed in a society? What is the Colour and Velvet Revolution? What is the approach of social psychology to the revolution?",Spring,SOCI 30605,,"Khoshk Jan, Z."
SOCI 20607,Sociology of the Arts. 100 Units.,"How does the society shape the arts, and how do the arts in turn shape our society? In this course, we will examine the social role of the arts by looking at a wide range of artistic disciplines, including visual art, performance art, music, dance and literature. We will discuss important themes such as how the artistic field is defined by social structures, how the arts may reinforce or challenge social norms, as well as the social dimensions of artistic creation, production, consumption and appreciation.",Spring,,,H.

SOCI 20608,The Social Life of Exchange. 100 Units.,"In this seminar, we will explore the social dimension of economic activities. We will discuss how this social aspect, often overlooked by the mainstream market economy, can represent an important component in economic exchanges. We will also look at some of the alternatives to the mainstream market economy, with a focus on the solidarity economy movement. The course consists of two main sections. First, we will go through the theoretical discussion on the social dimension of economic exchange activities. This will include the economic sociology discussions on the characteristics, mechanism and pitfalls of market economy and governmental interventions, as well as the various attempts at theorizing an alternative to these two mainstream economy models. We will also visit examples of how economic activities can happen outside the market economy, such as informal economy, gift economy and household labor. Second, we will explore the different forms of alternative economy in its diverse iterations. We will look at examples of solidarity economy from different regions across the globe, and examine organizations with different structures and missions, including cooperatives, credit unions, alternative currencies, community gardens, and food co-ops. We will also look at the challenges faced by solidarity economy practitioners on the ground, and will try to understand the prerequisites and strategies that may help initiatives realize their socioeconomic promises.",Winter,,,H.

SOCI 20609,Social Reproduction and Mobility in a Changing World. 100 Units.,"In an era of rapid transformation, individuals navigate diverse pathways to enhance their socioeconomic status and opportunities. While some pursue higher education or migrate across borders seeking upward social mobility, entrenched social structures frequently perpetuate familial and socioeconomic statuses through various mechanisms. For example, the increasing international student mobility not only illustrates how individuals with resources seek to enhance their future prospects through education but also extends our understanding of social structures and processes on a global scale. Characteristics such as gender and race often serve as barriers, reinforcing existing inequalities.",Winter,"SOCI 30609, EDSO 20609, MAPS 20609, EDSO 30609, MAPS 30609",,H. Jo

Students will learn how to describe populations and understand sampling, describe distributions of data, measure associations between variables, test the significance of associations and construct confidence intervals, and employ the main analytic workhorse of social science: regression modeling. This allows scientists to understand the associations between variables, controlling for the influence of confounding factors. This course is appropriate for anyone interested in getting started with quantitative analysis. Students will practice these techniques by analyzing social science data using R software, but it will not require prior coursework in social sciences. This course will not require matrix algebra or calculus.",Winter,"SOCI 30617, MAPS 30290",,"Jean, Marshall"
SOCI 20622,Political Sociology: Democratic Backsliding. 100 Units.,"This course brings a sociological approach to bear on a topic of great contemporary importance: democratic backsliding. We will define the phenomenon, situate it in the context of democratization and the project of democratic consolidation, and consider the larger theoretical story at stake (about the need to strengthen certain kinds of institutions). We will then examine a series of cases, including four cases of ""backsliding"" (the United States, India, Brazil, and the Philippines) and two non-democratic cases (China and Singapore). We will take seriously the question surely on the minds of many people in backsliding countries, i.e., ""Why democracy?"" The course will be reading-heavy and discussion-intensive, with readings drawn from political science, sociology, and economics.",Spring,SOCI 30622,,M. Garrido

We will explore the evolving architecture and geography of financialization, examining global capital flows at three levels: macro-economic trends, institutional structures, and individual actors driving capital accumulation. Key topics include China's economic rise, the growth of sovereign wealth funds, and the expansion of offshore financial centers that facilitate and obscure the global circulation of wealth. Special attention will be given to the ethical and social implications of these financial systems, particularly their role in exacerbating global inequality. By the end of the course, students will have a comprehensive understanding of how financialization shapes the global economy and its impact on everyday life.",Spring,,,K. Hoang

SALC 20210,"Making a Scene: Gender, Sexuality & Performance in Modern India. 100 Units.","This interdisciplinary course examines key topics, trajectories and analytical methods in the study of gender and sexuality, approaching them in the Global South context of modern and contemporary Indian society. As a postcolonial nation that recently decriminalized homosexuality (in 2018), yet where caste- and communally-motivated sexual violence is on the rise, the contemporary Indian context pushes us to reflect on how questions of gender and sexuality are animated, constituted and represented, especially within non-Euro/American frameworks. What theoretical concepts have universal purchase, and what is only ever legible in a local register? How do the forces of global capital and imperial power intervene in these processes? We will address these questions through the lens of performance, drawing on ethnographic, textual, visual and filmic sources from various Indian regions, communities and languages (in translation). We will journey through a range of sites and scenes, including courtesan cultures, queer nightlife, drag performances, classical arts, dramatic texts, political protests, and more. Through our eclectic readings and creative assignments, we will collectively question and expand our received notions of gendered and sexualized identities and difference.

The most important monument of early Indian civilization, it is an amalgam of heroic poetry, visionary speculation, hairsplitting philosophical analysis, austere legal disputation, animal fables, and dirty jokes. In this course, we will read (in translation) the monumental Sanskrit epic, as well as some of its many mediations-whether in vernacular literary renditions, centuries of sculptural and pictorial representations, or contemporary film and comic adaptations- with an eye to how we might consider this work as both a fundamental text for the understanding of South Asia and a vital part of the global cultural commons. No knowledge of South Asia or of any Indian language is presumed; the course will be a combination of lectures, small group discussions, and collective efforts at understanding this inexhaustible work.",,"SIGN 20401, SALC 30401",,
SALC 20513,Theater of Premodern South Asia. 100 Units.,"This course will cover the history and poetics of the stage play in premodern South Asia, which was, according to the eighth-century theorist Vāmana, ""the best among the types of literature."" The play, according to many premodern critics, was uniquely capable of bringing about a profound aesthetic experience because of its integration of diverse forms of art - plot-driven narrative, poetry, acting, and music. We will read a variety of plays in translation, including works by Bhāsa, Kālidāsa, Bhavabhūti, and Murāri, as well as selections from technical literature such as the Treatise on Theater (Nāṭyaśāstram). We will also watch a number of modern performances. Besides discussing individual plays, we will cover the following topics in detail: the different genres of the stage play; the theory of plot construction; the theory of aesthetic experience (rasa); the languages of the theater; the role of music, dance, and gesture; theater and ritual; and the performance tradition of Kūṭiyāṭṭam.",Winter,"SALC 30513, TAPS 20513, TAPS 30513","No prior knowledge of South Asian languages is required.

SALC 20615,Dalit Autobiographies: A socio-cultural account of Dalit and Other Marginalized Communities. 100 Units.,"The Seminar will explore the rise of Dalit literature in Maharashtra, especially the autobiographies (self-narration) and its impact on the Marathi language and culture. Since Independence Dalit (formerly untouchable and marginalized caste groups) and other marginalized communities within Indian society have gained access to spheres of social, educational, and economic life they had historically been excluded from. In the 1960s and 1970s Maharashtra witnessed the rise of a powerful Dalit Movement spearheaded by a new generation of poets, novelists, and autobiographers. The inspirational force behind this was no doubt, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar's powerful thoughts and his conversion to Buddhism along with thousands of Dalit followers. The seminar will focus on the distinctive lifeworld of Dalit Autographers, the diction and idioms used in their writing and the challenges of translating their work into English. Students will gain a deeper understanding of the vitality of language used by Dalit authors. They'll recognize Dalit autobiographies as a new genre or area of literature in India that corresponds to changes in the social, cultural, and political landscape. They'll witness how the first-person narratives of socially marginalized people shed a different light on South Asian Studies.",Spring,SALC 30615,,Sujata Mahajan

In the colonial period, multiple forms of supposed female deviancy began to be labeled with another term- ""prostitute""-leading to the loss of social status and legal rights of many women. In this course, we will study the evolution of prostitution and female otherness in South Asian cultural and political history. We will explore how the female deviant shaped religious, social and political life; how notions of sex, sexuality and intimacy informed classical dance, music, literature and performing arts; and how sex work came to be defined and stigmatized by the colonial and postcolonial states in South Asia.",Winter,"SALC 32482, GNSE 22482, GNSE 32482",,Ahona Panda

Combining theoretical, historical, and literary studies with sources in English translation, it invites students to consider comparatively a range of disciplinary approaches to the study of Islam in the subcontinent. The wide range of linguistic traditions that we will encounter in English analysis and English translation, which include Arabic, Awadhi, Bangla, Deccani, Hindi, Persian, and Urdu, gestures toward the broader themes of multi-regionalism, trans-communalism, and ecumenicalism highlighted in our readings. Some familiarity with the academic study of Islam will be helpful, but is not a prerequisite, since we will begin our quarter asking broad questions that we will continue to refine as we progress.

We first introduce the life of the Buddha and his major teachings within the context of the social and cultural environments in which Buddhism emerged about 2500 years ago. Having thus grasped some fundamental knowledge on Buddhism based on Pali texts, we then embark on examining its philosophical and historical developments from primitive Buddhism to sectarian Buddhism, and to the ramification of Theravada Buddhism in various countries such as Sri Lanka and Thai Land throughout its long history. Towards the end of the quarter, the class briefly discusses the revival of Theravada Buddhism in Indian in connection with the arising of Protestant Buddhism in Sri Lanka in the early 20th century.

SALC 25317,Traditions of Islamicate Learning In Mughal India. 100 Units.,"An introduction to the contexts, methods, and aims of Islamic education in late-Mughal South Asia in the decades immediately prior to European colonisation. Our central focus is an 18th century 'curriculum': a list of books that were read by a student of a famous madrasa in late-Mughal Delhi. Although madrasas are now widely considered to be places of strictly 'religious' education, our curriculum reveals the wide range of disciplines a student was expected to know. As well as subjects like Qurʾānic commentary and Islamic jurisprudence, students learned Arabic and Persian grammar, ethical texts, Sufism, Hellenistic philosophy, logic, medicine, martial arts, mathematics and geometry, poetry, accounting and secretarial skills, astronomy, as well as alchemical and occult sciences. We will learn with our Mughal-era student, moving through the disciplines that he studied - progressing from the introductory aspects of his education to more advanced subjects. As we go, we will read a wide range of Arabic and Persian primary sources in translation. We will consider what it meant to learn, the contexts in which learning took place, as well as the modes of ethical comportment that education entailed. We will also consider the changing nature of the madrasa curriculum against the background of the volatile political and social climate of 18th century Mughal South Asia. We will also examine the reformist ideas that were challenging classical educational paradigms in this period.",Autumn,,,Daniel Morgan
SALC 25319,Reading Indian Pasts: Early Texts and Modern Readers in South Asia. 100 Units.,"How do different readers read the same text differently? How have intellectuals in South Asia interpreted, and continue to interpret, their textual pasts? This course will explore questions related to the receptions of premodern South Asian texts, engaging students in debates in intellectual history and histories of reception, with a focus on questions of periodization, social categories, and constructions of identity in premodern South Asia. How, for example, have modern readers interpreted questions of caste and gender in early South Asian texts? How did premodern readers interpret their own textual pasts, and what are the tools by which we, as modern readers, may understand these negotiations? What are the stakes in and consequences of reading these debates in our own times? We will explore these and other questions through both primary and secondary materials. The course will enable students to explore broad conceptual questions related to histories of reading and debates in South Asian reception and intellectual history. Additionally, students will read sections of premodern texts, in translation, which have enjoyed significant lives outside their own times and contexts, alongside different interpretations of these texts. Students will work towards gaining conceptual tools to examine both premodern and modern texts as well as the many frameworks of interpretation that emerged out of them.

SALC 25321,Time and its discontents: thinking and experiencing time in South Asia through the ages. 100 Units.,"Time is fundamental to all ideas about the past and our projections to the future, yet our measures and conceptions of it change constantly. We will explore key concepts and themes around the temporal cultures of medieval and modern South Asia and how ideas and everyday experiences of time and history have taken shape in the intellectual exchange between South Asia and the West. What can a bored monk writing in medieval India teach us about our hurried digital life? What was the relationship between past and present in premodern South Asia? What can we learn about colonialism and capitalism studying work schedules of clerks in colonial India? Was medieval South Asia prior a land without history? From medieval to modern and from Mahābhārata to Marx, we will closely read a wide range of texts and other media hailing from both South Asia and the West. Students will analyze secondary and primary sources (in translation): religious works, manuals for time keeping, as well as texts describing personal experiences of time, like novels, diaries, etc. Students will develop critical tools for comparing and interpreting the life-worlds of non-Western regions. Our goal is to think of South Asia as an important site where our current concepts and propositions about time and history were developed.

SALC 25322,Enlightenment Modernity and Colonial South Asia. 100 Units.,"In Kant's words, the work of public reasoning was the condition for ""man's exit from self-imposed immaturity."" In the colony, however, the critique of existing society as insufficiently reasonable came to be caught up in the justification of Britain's ""liberal"" colonial project, and the obligation to Reason autonomously was embroiled in the case for empire. The Indian pursuit of enlightened reason was deeply aware of its uncomfortable proximity to empire, yet intellectuals of a variety of stripes advanced claims of ""enlightenment. Would the appeal to Reason bring about a new moral world or a derivatively imitative landscape? Could the Enlightenment be so truly universal that the colonized could claim it without disowning their past? What relationship would the moral resources of India's past share with the task social critique for a new generation of radical intellectuals? In order to address the promise and perils of colonial Enlightenment and its most controversial debates, this course will focus on a variety of primary and secondary sources. We will look at arguments penned by a range of Indian and British thinkers and at how the rich historiography of India's 19th century may be placed in productive dialogue with the normative theory produced by Europe's ""Enlightenment."" Turning to the history of 19th century India will help us complicate the history of the Enlightenment as a whole, and contribute to help draft a new and broader answer: what is ""Enlightenment?""",Spring,"HIST 26811, KNOW 25322",,T.

SALC 25323,Tolerance and Intolerance in South Asia. 100 Units.,"Few places in the world are as embroiled in the problem of diversity as South Asia, where sectarian violence-fought mainly along religious lines, but also along caste, gender, and linguistic lines-is at the center of political maneuvering. South Asia offers important lessons in how people manage to live together despite histories of mutual strife and conflict about communities and castes. Focusing on the period of British colonial rule, this class explores different instances and ideologies of toleration and conflict. How were South Asian discourses of toleration by such leaders as Gandhi and Nehru different from their European counterparts (e.g., John Locke and John Rawls)? How did their ideologies differ from those articulated by their minority peers such as Ambedkar, Azad, and Madani? We will analyze constitutive precepts, namely secularism, syncretism, toleration. Our attention here will be on the universal connotations of these ideas and their South Asian expression. Fifth week onward, we will turn our attention to select thinkers: Gandhi, Ambedkar, Azad, Madani. Our focus here will be on the ways that each intellectual negotiated the thorny issues of toleration, difference, ethnicity, and belonging. All the thinkers covered in this class had an active presence in nationalist era politics. Finally, we will read historical accounts of some of the most frequent causes of intolerance, namely cow slaughter, music played before the mosque, and desecration of sacred objects.",Spring,"CRES 25323, RLST 25323, HIST 26812, KNOW 25323",,T.

SALC 25326,Global Connections before Globalization: Sufis and Seafarers across the Indian Ocean. 100 Units.,"This course introduces students to the history of the Indian Ocean as a connected space in the centuries preceding widespread colonialism (ca. 1200-1600). In recent years, scholars have highlighted the Indian Ocean as a critical economic region in the 19th and 20th centuries. But before the industrial revolution and the invention of the steam engine, people from a variety of social backgrounds established contact with each other across Indian Ocean spaces. They formed religious communities, introduced new commodities and goods across space, or were forcibly enslaved and brought across the ocean against their will. By focusing on primary sources and first-person accounts-travelogues, letters, memoirs, and histories-we will explore the question of what we can learn about Indian Ocean worlds before globalization through consideration of individual lives. What picture do we get of a world on the brink of major social, political, and technological changes from reading about individuals' experiences? How can they decenter modern conceptions of space and periodization? In the course, we will pay special attention to the formation of religious networks, religious interactions, and histories of enslavement across the Indian Ocean.",Winter,"RLST 27392, HIST 25621",,Zoë W.

After a general introduction to Indo-Persian lyric poetry and the life and works of the three poets mentioned above, we will read a selection of their poetry and use Ustād Sarāhang's writings on poetry and music, as well as audio and video recordings of his performances as a prism for their interpretation. The first half of each class will be devoted to a preliminary textual approach of the poems, which will be followed by an analysis of the poems as performed by Ustād Sarāhang. We will pay close attention to the way the Afghan singer introduced the poems; how he used certain musical features to convey his understanding and appreciation of certain verses in a constant dialogue with his audience; how he used the insertion of verses from other poems to interpret certain images from the main poem he was performing. In addition to the poems and recordings, we will also read excerpts from Ustād Sarāhang's own writings and transcribed interviews found in his Qānūn-i ṭarab and the recent study of his life and works titled Jān-i kharābāt.",,SALC 35330,,
SALC 25400,That Age-old Debate: Youth Cultures in Modern India. 100 Units.,"In this course, we will aim to gain a deeper understanding of how certain key moments in postcolonial India - from innumerable student protests to an economic transition to globalization, and from the meteoric rise of Bollywood to the omnipresence of social media - have shaped the youth of the country and how young people in turn have been at the forefront of some of the major events and have created history on their own terms. We will ask what these experiences have done to concepts and notions of the youth. In other words, if youth is a construct like gender and caste then how was it constructed over the last seventy odd years? What were the desires and anxieties of the larger society that have shaped very distinctive trajectories for the youth in India? How were young people fashioning themselves and carving out their own social spaces? As we progress through the quarter, we will keep two guiding questions in mind - who all are considered to be the youth in postcolonial India? And - what are the lived experiences of young people during this time? The ever changing, seemingly arbitrary, and conflicting definitions of youth in government reports, commercial advertisements, or popular culture demands a thorough analysis of this significant and impact-making category inside out.",Winter,SALC 35400,No prior knowledge of any South Asian language is required.,Titas De Sarkar

A text of long-standing importance in Hindu traditions, the Bhagavad Gītā has had an especially interesting career in modernity, having been of great significance not only for M. K. Gandhi, but also for the likes of Thoreau and Eliot, not to mention the many less widely appreciated interpreters for whom the text's martial setting has been of central significance. After taking some steps to situate this great Sanskrit text in the context of its early Indian history, this course will explore a representative range of its available interpretations. Along the way, it is hoped that we will learn something not only about the Bhagavad Gītā, but also about the very ideas of interpretation and understanding.",Spring,RLST 24251,,Dan Arnold
SALC 25706,Problems in the Study of Gender and Sexuality: Inequality. 100 Units.,"This course analyzes inequality and the overt and covert violence that results from it. These inequalities are often grounded in gender and sex but also result from a complex intersection of gender, sex, and other identities. Inequality is what produces the experience of differential citizenship, a topic that exercises scholars the world over. In particular, those interested in issues of feminism, community, and ethnicity have studied why women (some women more than others) or particular social groups such as gay or trans groups, experience disenfranchisement more than their counterparts, even when, officially, many cultures/ nation states grant their members/citizens formal legal equality. Many of the examples around which this course is framed emerge out of South Asia, but our analyses will be structured through an engagement with theoretical texts that address issues of gendered oppression and discrimination in other parts of the world. Readings will include historical, anthropological, literary texts. Key themes of the course include: debates on parite in France and differential citizenship for religious minorities in India; caste based violence in India studied comparatively with debates on violence against aboriginal in Australia and Canada; rape and human rights; the politics of homosexuality; violence around popular and high culture; the panic around ""family values"".

This course provides a broad overview of South Asian archaeology and early history, from the beginnings of agricultural production to the expansion of states and empires in the early days of textual records. We cover critical anthropological processes such as the origins and expansion of agriculture, the development of one of the world's first urban societies-the Harappan or Indus civilization-the growth and institutionalization of social inequalities, and changing contexts of social and religious life. While the course actually extends a bit beyond the time of the Buddha, its major focus is on the periods up to and including the Early Historic. No prior experience of either South Asia or archaeology is assumed; indeed, we will think quite a bit about the nature of evidence and about how we know about the more distant past.",Spring,,,K.

Can inebriation lead to divine revelation? Who are the friends of God, and how did they develop fantastic superpowers? How have mystical practices sought to both abandon the world and radically transform it? In this class, we will explore these questions through the study of Sufism - a diverse set of Islamic mystical traditions - from its formative period in the early decades of Islam to the present day. Through poetry, philosophy, music, esoteric sciences, politics, and devotional practices, we will analyze Sufism as a global phenomenon that, while demonstrating remarkable adaptation to local cultural contexts, firmly locates itself within the Islamic tradition.

We will look at how literature and literacy have been defined in various contexts up to the colonial period and discuss what constituted the literary identity of Bengal's various linguistic traditions. We will approach the topics of reading practices and genres from the perspective of both material culture and the conceptual categories underlying literary genres and the linguistic economy of Bengal (scholastic and non-scholastic, classical and vernacular languages, individual reading and publicly performed texts, hinduyani and musalmani, etc. …). Even if Bengali language and literature stand at the center of this course, we will also discuss the literary traditions that predate the formation of Bengali literature and were part of the background of the making of Bengali texts (i.e. Sanskrit, Apabhramsha, Arabic, Persian, Maithili, and Awadhi literature). The aim of the course is to introduce students to pre- and early-colonial Bengali literature in its conceptual, aesthetic, and historical dimensions.

We first examine historical background for the arising of Humanistic Buddhism from Mahayana tradition in China and Buddhist revivalism or Protestant Buddhism, the forerunner of Engaged Buddhism in Sri Lanka almost simultaneously at the beginning of 20th century, and their subsequent developments respectively. Having then briefly reviewed some prominent figures such as Taixu (1898-1947), Dhammapala (1864-1933), and their major advocates, we undertake thorough comparative studies of the two Buddhisms by exploring several topics, including modern education and science, environment and ecology, human rights and feminism, politics and violence, suffering and happiness, and others. While discussing these topics, we also examine how Buddhism has transformed itself from the religion of other world to that of this world, how Buddhists have reinterpreted Buddhism in order to fit the idea and practice of modernity, an how new cultures have thus been recreated to cater for the needs of contemporary life both in the East and West.

SALC 28403,Text and World in Medieval India. 100 Units.,"This course is intended as a graduate seminar (undergraduates are welcome to attend, too) concentrating on the cultural and intellectual history of medieval southern Asia. For the purposes of the course, 'medieval' is roughly delimited by the half-millennium 700-1200 CE; 'southern Asia' refers mostly to the Indian subcontinent, with collateral attention paid to mainland and insular Southeast Asia. The recurrent focus will be on the reciprocal connections between texts-as physical artifacts, concretizations of cultural knowledge, articulations of traditions of wisdom, and realizations of intentional projects-and the social and physical world of their emergence and circulation. The class meetings will be divided between thematic and regional topics. Themes include the royal court, the nature of religious plurality, literary intertextuality, and the nature and efficacy of linguistic reference; regional concentrations include the Tamil country, Pāla-Sena Bengal, Angkor, central Java, and Kashmir.",Spring,SALC 48403,,Whitney Cox
SALC 28701,Acharya Vinoba Bhave's Contribution in Colonial and Post-colonial India. 100 Units.,"The course examines the life, work, and career of Acharya Vinoba Bhave (1895-1982) in colonial and postcolonial India. We read Bhave - who was widely touted as M.K. Gandhi's 'spiritual' successor - as developing a significant response to the cardinal questions and concerns of his time: building a national community free from stratification, exploitation, and communal strife while abiding by the values of non-violence (ahiṃsā) and truth (satya). Drawing upon Gandhi's ingenious mobilisation of the term, Bhave found his answer in the ideal of sarvodaya (universal upliftment) and laboured, throughout his long and illustrious life, to make it into an instrument of thought and action. This course will offer a multi-dimensional view of Vinoba's ideas and socio-political initiatives - including, but not limited to the well-known Bhoodan Movement (1951). We think about Bhave as a political thinker and actor while also paying due attention to some of his other, equally significant contributions. These would comprise his writings on education/pedagogy, ecological conservation, and India's religious philosophies and languages. Bhave's erudite and experimental wisdom in reinterpreting the revered Bhagavadgītā will receive special attention. We end by raising some questions of relevance. Are Vinoba Bhave's principles pertinent in the twenty-first century? Can they be reshaped according to our more global needs and made to speak to the many predicaments of a deeply destructive present?",Autumn,SALC 38701,,Sujata Mahajan

TAPS 20730,What makes a Classic Theater: from Core Mission to Concept. 100 Units.,"Instinctively we know what a classic is and does in our culture. From Coca Cola to Air Jordans, a classic is a material artifact that resonates across time, class, race, creed and nationality. A classic has staying power, whether it evolves, remains fresh, or re-invents itself in new contexts. In drama, a classic is a more fraught concept. The tradition of a classic canon has been rightly and thoroughly critiqued as racist, misogynist, and exclusionary. In spite of this, the idea of a classic still abides and holds sway in the cultural imaginary. Taught by Associate Artistic Director Gabrielle Randle-Bent, this course takes as its point of departure that Court Theatre is ""The Center for Classic Theatre."" We begin with the question: What are the practical, critical, and dramaturgical implications for an institution committing to the production of classic work? We will read literary and dramatic criticism to better understand the idea of classic text, we will study the structure of modern regional theatre to interrogate the economic necessity for the production of classic work on contemporary stages, and finally we will read canonical, a-canonical, and new works of theatre to begin to articulate a dramaturgy of Classic Theatre on our own terms.",Spring,,,G.

In alternating weeks, students implement textual analysis in building an understanding of directorial concept, theme, imagery and staging through rehearsal and in-class presentations of three-minute excerpts from the play analysis the previous week. The culmination is a final five-minute scene combining the tools of direction with a method of analysis devised over the entire course.",Autumn,CHST 23000,,S. Murray

TAPS 23980,"Writing the Short, Short Play: Investigations in Micro-Drama. 100 Units.","Never in the history of western theater has brevity gotten so much attention. Festivals around the world are devoted to plays five minutes in length or less; perhaps the most revered playwright of the 20th century, Samuel Beckett, guided his career towards the writing of smaller and smaller works; Chicago's Neofuturists have profitably run their show of ""thirty plays in sixty minutes"" for over thirty years; Twitter accounts disseminate multiple two to three line scripts daily; and sketch comedy continues to evolve and thrive. This course will give an overview of the development of the very short play over the last one hundred and twenty years, but will primarily focus on the writing and development of same, asking students to complete - through workshop prompts - 20 to 30 scripts by end of quarter. A particular effort will be made to bring ""traditional"" elements of standard-length plays - character, arc, anagnorisis, pathos, backstory, etc - to these miniatures, to test and expand their assumed limitations.",Winter,TAPS 33980,,M.

TAPS 25050,Adaptation Laboratory: Staging Berlin at Court Theatre. 100 Units.,"From 2000-2018, the graphic novelist Jason Lutes published Berlin, a sprawling, formally inventive, & idiosyncratic account of life in the German capital city during the years just prior to National Socialism. Court Theatre, the Tony award winning professional theater on the UChicago campus, has commissioned the playwright Mickle Maher to prepare an adaptation of Lutes' novel for Court's 2024-25 season; David Levin is the collaborating dramaturg. This interdisciplinary team-taught seminar invites students into the process of adaptation, exploring a range of practical, conceptual & artistic challenges. The course will take place in two locations: at Court Theatre (where we will attend rehearsals for the world premiere production, from first rehearsal through opening) and in a theater lab on campus, where we will consider a range of critical and creative materials - e.g., Lisa Kron and Jeanine Tesori's adaptation of Alison Bechdel's graphic novel Fun Home or Walter Ruttmann's 1927 film ""Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis"" - to establish a dialogue between Lutes' novel, its progenitors, and the work in Court's rehearsal room. An additional & significant component of our work will involve creative exercises. Students will prepare adaptations of their own - first, of Lutes' novel, then of works of their own choosing. Artists from Court's production will join us for workshop sessions. The seminar aims to serve as a creative and critical forum, exploring the challenges of adaptation.",Winter,"TAPS 35050, ARTV 20807, ARTV 30807, CDIN 25050, GRMN 35050, CDIN 35050",An interest in the graphic novel and/or 20th century German history & culture is welcome but not required.

ARTV 20037,Generous Gravities. 100 Units.,"Generous Gravities is a comparative study of two distinct cultural experiences in the production, influence and imposition of cultural power and how artistic production has been influenced in response. The production of a culture is a messy, promiscuous affair. Rather than a conception of culture as a singular set of values, built up from a singular core, what we call the culture of a place is a result of an endless process of accrual, rejection, imposition and influence. Specifically, the class will focus on the city of Paris both as case study and antecedent of our conception of the cosmopolitan in the 19th and 20th century along with the Republic of Georgia's historical experience in the 20th and early 21st century. These two places give us sites to think through ideas of renewal and exchange between radically different ideological and aesthetic systems and the complex cultures produced as a result of centuries long processes. In the 19th century, Paris was the origin point for a set of specific cultural currents that combined to make something new, perverse and alive - what we today call The Cosmopolitan - before their subsequent fraying at the end of the twentieth century. Today as it was in the past, the Republic of Georgia stands at an intersection of some of the most important forces of the early 21st century while at the same time in the midst of a creative explosion within its cultural economy.",,ARTV 30037,,

ARTV 20805,"Framing, Re-framing, and Un-framing Cinema. 100 Units.","By cinema, we mean the art of the moving image, which is not limited to the material support of a flexible band called film. This art reaches back to early devices to trick the eye into seeing motion and looks forward to new media and new modes of presentation. With the technological possibility of breaking images into tiny pixels and reassembling them and of viewing them in new way that this computerized image allows, we now face the most radical transformation of the moving image since the very beginnings of cinema. A collaboration between the OpenEndedGroup (Marc Downie and Paul Kaiser), artists who have created new modes of the moving image for more than decade, and film scholar Tom Gunning, this course will use this moment of new technologies to explore and expand the moving image before it becomes too rigidly determined by the powerful industrial forces now propelling it forward. This course will be intensely experimental as we see how we might use new computer algorithms to take apart and re-experience classic films of the past. By using new tools, developed for and during this class, students will make new experiences inside virtual reality environments for watching, analyzing, and recombining films and that are unlike any other.

Discussions, initially held among class members and subsequently expanded to involve external scholars, will pivot around the following questions: 0. Do and should artists consider the placement of their work? 1. How can artists examine and challenge their perceived biography? 2. What are the functions of a collection/gallery/museum? 3. How can artists inaugurate supportive and meaningful infrastructures around their practice and activate them as crucial toolsets for engagement and interpretation? 4. Where and how, ultimately, can context appear most plausible? Routine visits to study rooms and archives, among other sites in Chicago, are considered major components of this course, so students should be prepared to use public transport and carpool. The final project of this class, as it stands now, will entail the design of an imaginary collection/gallery/museum in Chicago with concomitant programming according to each artist's interests and points of view.
